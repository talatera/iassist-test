scripting, build and testing tools and all members of the Application
Development and Maintenance section use Continuous Integration and
Testing on a daily basis.

The UK Data Archive is in the process of redeveloping a number of its
legacy applications, using new processes, tools and architectures. The
post holder will be part of a small team of developers that is
responsible for the design and implementation of Service Oriented
Architecture (SOA) components, plus the maintenance and eventual
migration to the SOA of legacy databases.

This is a full-time, fixed-term post until 30 September 2012.
