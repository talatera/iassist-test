The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is a new
organization at the University of Washington. Its mission is to monitor
global health conditions and health systems, as well as to evaluate
interventions, initiatives, and reforms. It also will build an audience
of interested policymakers, researchers, donors, and other decision
makers in health who are interested in learning more about how to apply,
use, and derive better evidence in global health.

IHME has an outstanding opportunity for a Data Librarian. The Data
Librarian will be the central resource within IHME on health data, both
for internal availability and the global health data landscape. The Data
Librarian will develop and improve processes and standards for data
archiving, management of data needs, and facilitating efficient data
retrieval, and play a central role in developing the IT infrastructure
for data management. The Data Librarian will report to the Global Data
Bank Director.
