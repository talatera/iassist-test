The UW-Madison Libraries seek two creative, collaborative, and
user-oriented Science & Engineering Data & Information Specialists to
contribute to developing a forward-looking suite of research services
for the UW-Madison science and engineering community. The successful
candidates will play a key role in expanding support for research
workflows and data management in collaboration with the Digital Curation
Coordinator and other campus partners, such as Research Data Services.
As members of one of our research engagement teams, the Science &
Engineering Data & Information Specialists will also contribute to
developing a programmatic approach to expand our engagement and deepen
connections with faculty, staff, and students. Positions are available
in both the life sciences and physical sciences/engineering, and the
successful candidates will be matched to the position that best aligns
with their experience, skills, and interests. Early career candidates
are encouraged to apply.

The Science and Engineering Data & Information Specialists will be part
of the Science & Engineering Libraries - a dynamic, innovative, and
collegial team of library staff that is building a wide range of
services and partnerships supporting personal information organization
and research workflows, research data management, open research,
scholarly publishing, research identity management, research impact,
innovation and entrepreneurship, and the STEM learning experience. A
core guiding principle is to foster diversity and inclusiveness within
STEM, our services, and our work environment. Our team is looking for
colleagues who are interested in collaborating with faculty, staff, and
students to advance knowledge creation and sharing in science and
technology that will help to address society's grand challenges.

The Science and Engineering Libraries (SEL) are comprised of a network
of seven libraries - Astronomy Library, Chemistry Library, Geology and
Geophysics Library, Math Library, Physics Library, Steenbock Memorial
Library, and Wendt Commons Library. Together, they have primary
responsibility for serving the College of Agricultural and Life
Sciences, the College of Engineering, the science departments, centers
and programs of the College of Letters & Science, the School of
Veterinary Medicine, and the UW Extension/Cooperative Extension.

The Libraries at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are dedicated to
the practices of social justice, diversity, equality, and respect among
our staff, students, collections, and services. We strive to overcome
historical and divisive biases in our society and embrace diverse points
of view as assets to the fabric of our community. All positions will be
called on to contribute to building this environment.
