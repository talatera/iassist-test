Reporting to the Director of the Collaboratory, the Data Services and
Digital Scholarship Librarian develops and implements programming that
supports data-centric research across the disciplines, including
workshops, online learning objects, and course-connected instruction;
provides consultation services for faculty, graduate students, and
undergraduates in all Collaboratory areas, including but not limited to
social science, spatial, and social media data; engages in extended
project work with faculty researchers; consults on scholarly
communication issues, particularly in regards to appropriate use and
stewardship of research data; and maintains active Software/Data
Carpentry instructor certification (<https://carpentries.org/>).

The Data Services and Digital Scholarship Librarian works individually
and as part of the Collaboratory team to contribute to creative and
innovative approaches to advancing and promoting the Collaboratory's
services; participates in an active instructional program, including
developing and delivering presentations to specialized undergraduate and
graduate courses; creates and maintains online guides to specialized
Library resources, including but not limited to Twitter data acquisition
and analytics platforms, R, and Python data analytics; and designs
workshop curriculum and learning objects for Software, Data, Library,
and Author Carpentry.

The Data Services and Digital Scholarship Librarian will assist the
Collaboratory Director with collection management and development for
the Library's data collections. Collection development and management
responsibilities include but are not limited to selection, assessment,
and lifecycle management of data resources that support scholarship and
teaching. These data resources may be created, harvested, purchased, or
licensed by the Library or our partners. Recognizing the unique strength
of interdisciplinary scholarship on the UC Santa Barbara campus, the
Data Services and Digital Scholarship Librarian works collaboratively
with librarians in other units to develop scholarly collections and
provide access to resources that cross traditional disciplinary
boundaries and support new fields of inquiry.
