The Stanford University Libraries' Center for Interdisciplinary Digital
Research (CIDR) is seeking a full-time Digital Scholarship Research
Developer to build sophisticated, sustainable, and generalizable tools
and platforms in order to support interdisciplinary research in the
computational social sciences and digital humanities at Stanford.
Regular tasks will include programming, analyzing, designing,
developing, deploying, modifying, and maintaining computer programs in
systems of moderate size and complexity or segments of larger systems.

Reporting to the head of CIDR, the successful candidate will join a
distinguished and widely-recognized team of software developers and
academic and library technologists with combined decades of expertise in
the computational social sciences and digital humanities. Its activities
support research and teaching in these fields for the Stanford
community. CIDR collaborates both with individual faculty and with
Departments, Centers and Institutes engaged in digital research, such as
the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA); the Institute for
Research in the Social Sciences (IRiSS); the Stanford Humanities Center;
and the Center for Computational Social Sciences. CIDR is also a hub for
collaboration and communication among social science and digital
humanities scholars, library curators, and professional developers,
promoting a sense of shared purpose in support of the Stanford mission
of research and teaching.

The successful candidate will be a skilled software developer with a
deep understanding of scholarship in the social sciences. The candidate
will consult and collaborate with faculty on scholarly projects to
identify technical approaches, processes and tools; evaluate and
integrate existing software tools; and design and implement new
solutions. The candidate should have both a broad and deep understanding
of current state of the art in computational social sciences,
familiarity and ability to collaborate on digital humanities projects,
as well as experience developing full-stack software for one or more of
these domains: information visualization; statistical and textual
analysis; natural language processing; large dataset management and
transformation; digital content creation, storage, and discovery;
geospatial analysis; high performance and secure computing concepts; or
network analysis.

The candidate will also contribute to the CIDR workshop series through
planning and teaching pragmatic, interactive workshops related to
digital scholarship. Through this activity and others, the candidate
will promote and represent CIDR, improving the visibility of its
programs and its reputation across campus and beyond; liaise with peers
at other academic institutions and in industry; seek and develop funding
opportunities; publish and present at professional conferences; review
professional literature; participate in discussion groups and other
forums to stay abreast of new methodologies and practices relevant to
the computational social sciences and related fields.

**CORE DUTIES*:**


-   Conceptualize design, implement, and develop solutions for complex
    systems/programs independently.
-   Work with a variety of users to gain information, and develop
    intra-system tradeoffs between different users, as necessary;
    interact with a diverse client base and outside vendor contacts.
-   Document system builds and application configurations; maintain and
    update documentation as needed.
-   Provide technical analysis, design, development, conversion, and
    implementation work.
-   Work as a project leader, as needed, for projects of moderate
    complexity.
-   Serve as a technical resource for applications.
-   Compare, evaluate, and implement new features and technologies, and
    integrate them into the computing environment.
-   Follow team software development methodology.
-   Mentor lower level software developers.


***Additional Duties May Include:**

-   Advise, consult, and collaborate with faculty to provide project
    definition and analysis, including defining project scope,
    requirements and specifications, and project design. Recommend and
    assist with the integration and use of technology in faculty and
    library projects.
-   Contribute to the CIDR workshop series through planning and teaching
    interactive workshops related to digital scholarship.
-   Promote and represent CIDR, improving the visibility of its programs
    across campus and within academic and professional circles
-   Liaise with peers at other academic institutions and in industry,
    seek and develop funding opportunities, publish and present at
    professional conferences.
-   Review professional literature; participate in discussion groups and
    other forums to stay abreast of new methodologies and practices
    relevant to the computational social sciences.
