Are you a software developer with expertise in writing code for online
applications using some combination of Java/J2EE, Perl, SOAP/XML or
PostgreSQL/MySQL? Do you enjoy engaging with end-users to understand
their requirements? And do you have an understanding of data management
issues within a research context? If so, we invite you to apply for the
role of Software Developer for two data management projects at Oxford
University Computing Services (OUCS).

OUCS has been awarded funding from JISC to develop and pilot
infrastructure for the management of data within the life sciences and
the humanities. The Software Developer is responsible for developing
lightweight online applications that integrate research processes
involving data management with institutional data storage and management
infrastructure. The post holder will be expected to consult and
collaborate with key contacts within the participating academic
departments, services providers such as the Library Services, and
existing technical teams.
