Founded in 1967, the UK Data Archive (UKDA) is an
internationally-renowned centre of expertise in data acquisition,
preservation, dissemination and promotion; and is curator of the largest
collection of digital data in the social sciences and humanities in the
UK. It provides a family of services for a range of national and
international organisations focussed around the provision of access to
data for research, teaching and learning as well as the provision of
preservation services.

Due to continued growth and expansion the UKDA is looking to appoint a
highly motivated and enthusiastic senior manager whose responsibilities
will include providing management and co-ordination support in terms of
strategic and business planning, including project planning, process
monitoring and report writing. The ability to think strategically,
together with proven communication, networking and report-writing
skills, is therefore essential.
