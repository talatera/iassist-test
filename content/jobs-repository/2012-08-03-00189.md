The Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies is a joint
initiative of the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the South African
Medical Research Council, with support from the Wellcome Trust and other
funders, to create a global centre of research excellence in a rural
area. The Centre's mission is to conduct, in partnership with the
community, policy-relevant health and population research in an ethical
manner, and to enhance the capacity of the people of sub-Saharan Africa
to conduct research.

The Centre is located in the rural Umkhanyakude District of
KwaZulu-Natal. It hosts a number of clinical and social research
projects, including Africa's most comprehensive Demographic Surveillance
System, which monitors longitudinal vital events in a population of 90
000 and provides a rich base for health and social science research.
Employees of the Africa Centre are encouraged to gain a broad experience
across all studies in order to develop their own skills and advance
their careers.
