New York University in Abu Dhabi seeks an energetic, creative, and
knowledgeable librarian to select, acquire, manage, and deliver numeric
data collections to support campus research and scholarship.  The
incumbent in this new position will work closely with NYU librarians in
Abu Dhabi and in New York as well as technologists, faculty, and
students to develop a new Data Service Studio in Abu Dhabi. Beginning at
the University's temporary site in downtown Abu Dhabi, the facility will
move and expand in 2014 with the move to a permanent new campus. Working
in downtown Abu Dhabi, a beautiful modern city on the shores of the
Arabian Gulf, the incumbent contributes to providing information and
research assistance to the gifted faculty and student body of NYU in Abu
Dhabi, often called the "world's honors college."

Reporting to the Associate Director for Academic Technology, the
librarian will build data collections and facilitate access to
additional data resources; engage in outreach to faculty and students
through subject and departmental liaison activities; design and conduct
data literacy instruction; participate in reference and consultation
activities as a part of the NYU-Abu Dhabi Library team; provide and
develop innovative services in support of research, teaching, and
learning; and teach research strategies in a variety of contexts.

The incumbent will participate in committees, activities, and special
projects, especially those involving new technologies and data, and
develop and maintain awareness of data-centered initiatives across the
sciences and social sciences through professional development
activities.

The work location is the Abu Dhabi campus downtown location, interim to
the completion of the permanent campus on Saadiyat Island. Living and
working in the United Arab Emirates presents an exciting and excellent
professional environment, coupled with an abundance of cultural,
educational, recreational and travel opportunities.
