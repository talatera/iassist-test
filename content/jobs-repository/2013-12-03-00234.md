A number of lectureships have been or will be created as a part of the
national programme of activities in the UK to support undergraduate use
of quantitative data in the classroom, known as Q-Step.

See individual listings - this is just an FYI. Positions will continue
to be posted at the above site for lectureships at the 15 funded Q-Step
centres.
