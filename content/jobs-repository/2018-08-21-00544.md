The UC Berkeley Library is an internationally renowned research and
teaching facility at one of the nation's premier public universities. A
highly diverse and intellectually rich environment, Berkeley serves a
campus community of 30,000 undergraduate students, over 11,000 graduate
students, and 1,500 faculty. With a collection of more than 12 million
volumes and a collections budget of over $15 million, the Library
offers extensive collections in all formats and robust services to
connect users with those collections and build their related research
skills. The Library's mission and strategic plan can be viewed
at <http://stories.lib.berkeley.edu/strategicplan/>.

The Library's Social Sciences Division consists of four subject
libraries -- Anthropology, Business, Environmental Design, and Social
Research -- and the collections and services located in Doe
Library/Gardner MAIN Stacks. Collectively, the staff -- 12 librarians,
12 library staff, and over 50 student library employees -- support the
research, teaching, and study needs of students and faculty in twelve
social science departments within the College of Letters & Science, six
professional schools, three International and Area Studies programs, and
an array of Organized Research Units.

Sociology is one of the largest and most diverse undergraduate majors at
Berkeley, with a strong focus on research and a deep engagement with
critical theory. Demography, one of the quintessential quantitative
social sciences, is highly interdisciplinary with particularly strong
connections to Sociology, Public Policy, Economics, Public Health and
Data Sciences.

Responsibilities

Reporting to the Head of the Social Sciences Division, the Sociology,
Demography & Quantitative Research Librarian serves as a liaison to two
academic departments. Liaisons at Berkeley are expected to establish
strong relationships with the faculty and students of their departments,
and to actively participate in the Library's reference, outreach, and
instructional services. This includes providing in-person reference,
virtual reference, individual research consultations, promotion of
library resources and services, in-person classes, and the development
of online subject guides and instructional material.

The librarian will be responsible for collection development, management
and assessment for Sociology and Demography. This includes collaborating
with other librarians on campus and within the UC System on
interdisciplinary and/or system-wide collection decisions, and working
with librarians nationally and internationally on issues related to
improved access for legacy print and digital collections.

The librarian will also play a key role in supporting quantitative
research methods across the social sciences, partnering with library
staff and campus partners -- such as the GIS/Map Librarian, Data
Services Librarian, Government Information Librarian, Social Sciences
D-Lab and Research Data Management Program -- to assist faculty,
students, and staff. The librarian will work particularly closely with
the Anthropology & Qualitative Research Librarian to support qualitative
and mixed methods research in Sociology.

UC Berkeley librarians and academic staff are expected to participate in
library-wide planning and governance, and work effectively in a shared
decision-making environment. Advancement is partially based upon
professional contributions beyond the primary assignment; the successful
candidate will show evidence or promise of such contributions to the
Library, campus, UC System, and profession.
