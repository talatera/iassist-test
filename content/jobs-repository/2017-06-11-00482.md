The Institute for Analytics and Data Science (IADS) seeks to appoint a
full-time Postdoctoral Research Fellow to start on or after 1 August
2017 to support the Institute's work in analytics, data science and Big
Data. On successful completion of the Fellowship and probation period,
the Research Fellow will be appointed to a permanent Lecturer post in
the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering.


We wish to add to the Institute's capability to undertake world class
research and development work as well as open up and develop new
research activities in this area that will become recognized as
outstanding and internationally leading. We seek highly motivated,
enthusiastic and professional candidates who have excellent knowledge of
computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning or text
analytics, and possess strong software engineering and programming
skills in high level programming languages such Java, C, Perl and
Python. Particular research areas of interest include but are not
limited to:

-   machine learning;
-   reinforcement learning, neural networks, deep learning;
-   data mining;
-   predictive analytics;
-   natural language processing and advanced text analytics;
-   semantic information extraction and the Semantic Web;
-   social media analysis;
-   handling of data in motion (multi-stream processing and reasoning,
    complex event processing and reasoning);
-   decision support tools and systems.

The Fellowship is for a fixed term because it is for a period of career
development. During the period of the Fellowship, the Research Fellow
will be on a probation period of three years. To enable the Fellow to
meet the requirements of probation, and to provide a good foundation in
higher education practice for the Fellow's ongoing career, they will be
allocated a limited amount of teaching and supervision in the School of
Computer Science and Electronic Engineering.

quality independent and collaborative research that meets Research
Excellence Framework (REF) standards within the Institute for Analytics
and Data Science. This could include, but not be limited to:

-   Develop research objectives and proposals;
-   Use new research techniques and methods and use initiative and
    creativity to identify areas of research and new research methods;
-   Use creativity to analyse and interpret the research data and draw
    conclusions of the outcomes;
-   Author and co-author research papers;
-   Develop and undertake applied research in collaboration with
    businesses and other stakeholders;
-   Attendance and contributions (presentations) to annual international
    conferences;
