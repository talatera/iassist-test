The [Council on Libraries and Information Resources
(CLIR)](http://www.clir.org/) is seeking academic libraries, data
centers, or other research institutions interested in hosting 2016-2018
postdoctoral fellows. Fellows work on projects that forge and strengthen
connections among library collections, educational technologies, and
current research.

CLIR is soliciting hosts for three tracks within the Postdoctoral
Fellowship Program. Funding arrangements for each track vary:

-   *Postdoctoral Fellowships in Data Curation for the Sciences and
    Social Sciences*, **particularly software curation**, are designed
    by hosts who apply to the program and are selected by CLIR;
    educational benefits are funded by CLIR, partial salary support for
    fellows in software curation funded by CLIR.
-   *Postdoctoral Fellowships in Data Curation for Medieval Studies* are
    designed by hosts who apply to the program and are selected by CLIR;
    CLIR pays full salaries for fellows.
-   *Postdoctoral Fellowships in Academic Libraries* are open to any
    discipline. Fellowships are designed and funded by hosts, who also
    pay fees to CLIR to cover the costs of fellows' education.
