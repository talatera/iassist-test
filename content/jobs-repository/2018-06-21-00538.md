The Stanford University Libraries' Center for Interdisciplinary Research
(CIDR) is seeking an innovative, experienced, team-oriented Academic
Technology Specialist for the Institute for Research in the Social
Sciences (IRiSS) in Stanford's School of Humanities and Sciences, to
help lead the integration of technology into data-driven research
activities in the social sciences at Stanford. Regular tasks will
include consulting and collaborating with members of the Stanford
community including faculty, students, and other research personnel,
administrative and technical staff at business and support units from
across the University. The candidate will engage in analyzing,
designing, developing, and implementing computational tools and
environments for social science research primarily housed in the six
social science depts.

The Academic Technology Specialist will be based jointly in IRiSS and
the Stanford Libraries, where s/he will be part of a distinguished and
widely-recognized team of other academic technologists and software
developers with combined decades of expertise in the computational
social sciences and digital humanities, whose activities support
research and teaching in these fields for the Stanford community. CIDR
collaborates both with individual faculty and with centers, departments
and institutes engaged in digital scholarship, particularly in the
social sciences, digital humanities, and within the related professional
schools where similar work occurs. CIDR is also a hub for collaboration
and communication among social science and digital humanities scholars,
library curators, and professional developers, promoting a sense of
shared purpose in support of the Stanford mission of research and
teaching.

The successful candidate will have a deep understanding of scholarship
in the social sciences, and particularly with social science data. S/he
will consult and collaborate with faculty and students on research
projects to identify technical approaches, processes and tools; evaluate
and integrate existing software tools; and design and implement new
solutions. That candidate should have both a broad and deep
understanding of current state of the art in social science research
methods, emerging tools, and increased data security requirements as new
methods seek data that include PII/PHI, as well as experience working
with data visualization; statistical analysis; high performance
computing; secure storage and computation; secure data provisioning and
contracting; cloud computing; and other areas.
