UCD Library is organised into the following areas: Client Services;
Collection Services; Cultural Heritage (Special Collections); Planning
and Administration/Library IT; Research Services.

The successful candidate will be joining the Research Services Unit in a
period of change. The person appointed will demonstrate an enthusiasm
for the changing information landscape and the ongoing development of
library services including the implementation of new processes and
services. To facilitate the effective achievement of UCD Library's
strategic goals and to support staff development and engagement, active
and positive collaboration with colleagues across the Library will be a
key feature of this role.

The requirement for UCD researchers to manage research data will
increase given the emerging mandates from funding organisations to make
research data available in open access repositories. To help meet this
requirement UCD Library is recruiting a data manager who will coordinate
and streamline existing services and develop new services, liaising and
collaborating with both internal users and suppliers of data (Schools,
Institutes and other research areas); other research areas such as
Research IT, UCD Research, Corporate & Legal; and also external users
and agencies such as CSO, ESRI and other data producers.

This is a new post and offers great scope for an individual to provide
leadership in the development of this important new service area. There
will be opportunities for skills development specific to this post and
also in related areas to support the overall work of the Research
Services unit.
