The University of Edinburgh seeks to appoint a Research Data Management
Service Coordinator to spearhead the development of a compelling
user-shaped Research Data Management service for the University of
Edinburgh academic community. The University is at the forefront of the
evolving research data management domain, and this post will help build
a sustainable service to ensure that researchers are able to store and
manage their data in a seamless and secure fashion, enabling them to
easily manage, manipulate, share and preserve their data either at
Edinburgh or in a trusted repository elsewhere.

  

The key aspects of the role are Programme and Project Management skills,
Requirements Gathering and Analysis, Communications, and Advocacy. This
post is suitable for applicants who wish to work at the forefront of
Research Data Management practice, and who are willing to take
responsibility for the coordination of the Research Data Management
Service of a prestigious research institution. Candidates will likely
possess a Research, Library, or IT background, but will excel in a mixed
environment.
