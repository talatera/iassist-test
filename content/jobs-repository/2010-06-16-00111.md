We are seeking a Research Data Librarian/Project Manager to work within
the Information Resources Team at Swinburne University. You will be
responsible for planning and assisting to implement a research data
management service jointly managed by Swinburne Library and Swinburne
Research. You will work with a range of internal and external
stakeholders to develop, promote and coordinate a service that is
well-organised, recognised and meets priority needs of researchers. A
key deliverable will be to populate the Australian Research Data Commons
(ARDC) with information about research data collections supporting the
discovery of, and access to, research data held at Swinburne University.

The successful applicant will actively develop their own knowledge and
skills in this growing area and share experiences with colleagues both
within Swinburne University and other Australian research organisations.
Demonstrated experience in the planning of information, research or data
management projects or services is essential.
