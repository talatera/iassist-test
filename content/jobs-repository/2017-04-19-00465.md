Queen's University Library is looking for a Research Data Management
Systems Librarian to join our team and play a key role in building the
infrastructure needed to support students and faculty at Queen's
University with the management of research data, including big data
generated by computationally intensive research programs. In developing
this infrastructure we are partnering with Scholars Portal, a technology
support service for Ontario's 21 academic libraries with experience in
managing large collections of scholarly resources and building
infrastructure to support digital preservation and access at scale.

The Librarian will work at Queen's University and participate as a
member of the Scholars Portal Data and GIS Services team to develop a
local and provincial research data management infrastructure integrated
into a larger developing network of data management services across
Canada. To achieve this vision, the Librarian will collaborate with the
Centre for Advanced Computing and other partners at Queen's University,
coordinate with other academic libraries in Ontario and participate in
the efforts of Portage, the Canadian Association of Research Libraries'
initiative working to help local and regional infrastructure developers
integrate at the national level.
