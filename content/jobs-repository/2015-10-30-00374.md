The School of Information at the University of Michigan (UMSI) seeks to
hire a tenure-track professor at the Assistant or Associate Professor
rank who conducts research in the multidisciplinary field of digital
curation. Broadly construed, digital curation research includes digital
curation technologies and methods, representation and interpretation of
heterogeneous digital content and collections, integrity and user
acceptance, interoperability, and long-term sustainability.  

We favor candidates with strong interest and expertise in:

-   Methods to assess and improve the quality of data that originate
    from formal and informal sources, such as research data, social
    media trace data, and citizen science
-   Models and methods to extract and trace data provenance, and
    correspondingly, methods to use provenance in analysis, quality
    assessment, and reasoning about, linking, and retrieving data
-   Incentives for data sharing and models for reuse of digital data
-   Ontologies and models (general and domain-specific) that make it
    possible to conceptualize, act, and reason about data in a more
    atomic and structured fashion
-   Policy, algorithmic, organizational, and practice-based methods to
    mitigate privacy and security problems with digital data

For all UMSI positions, we favor candidates whose research interests
complement our existing expertise in such areas as computer-supported
cooperative work; digital archives and preservation; human-computer
interaction; incentive-centered design and information economics;
information seeking, sharing and use; Internet-scale data, network and
text analysis; social computing and informatics; and health
informatics.  This new faculty position provides the opportunity for
interdisciplinary collaboration in the context of the University's
recently announced $100M investment in data science
(<http://midas.umich.edu>).
  
-   Ph.D. in an area such as information science, archival science,
    computer science, informatics or fields  related to digital curation
    including social science
-   Demonstrated potential for successful teaching at the undergraduate
    and graduate levels
-   Demonstrated potential for high scholarly impact
-   A strong commitment to teaching, interdisciplinary research, and
    cultural diversity
