Simon Fraser University Library is seeking a highly flexible,  
collaborative and innovative individual, committed to providing the  
best possible service to faculty and students, to undertake a range of
 
project-based and operational activities that will advance the SFU  
Library's strategic objectives for expanded research data curation and
 
management services.

Reporting to the Associate University Librarian for Library Technology
 
Services and Special Collections, this is a unique opportunity that  
combines a major research data project funded by the University  
Priority Fund (UPF) with the implementation of several key objectives  
for research data services in the Library's Strategic Plan for  
2011-2016.  The Data Curator will play an important leadership role on
 
the UPF-funded project while also working closely with the Library's  
Research Data Librarian to plan and implement the Library's vision for
 
expanded services and support for research data.  An important part of
 
the latter activity will require participation in succession and  
related transition planning for  Research Data  Services.   This is a  
continuing position at the SFU Library.

The Data Curator will play a leading role in providing guidance and  
support in long-term management of research data, including issues of  
data preservation and access, intellectual property rights, and  
security of sensitive data. The position will be based in Research  
Data Services with close working relationships with Library Systems ,  
Research Commons, the Library's Liaison Librarians, and the Library's  
Institutional Repository staff. The position will collaborate with  
staff from both inside and outside the library devoted to supporting  
research data management throughout the different phases of the data  
life cycle. The Data Curator will interact with faculty, students, and
 
various academic and administration units throughout the university  
and will be responsible for the development and administration of  
policies, workflows, and infrastructure/repositories regarding the  
management of datasets and related resources. This is a new position  
in the SFU Library that will incorporate existing and emerging  
elements of research data support and services.  It is an opportunity  
for the right candidate to help create and establish new services for  
long-term curation and management of research data at SFU.
