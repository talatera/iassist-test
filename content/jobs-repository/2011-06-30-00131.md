The development of Regional Strategic Resource Centres (ReSRCs) is an
exciting new initiative in Ontario's innovation system, supported by the
Ministry of Research and Innovation (MRI) and coordinated by MaRS in
partnership with a range of stakeholders.

The ReSRCs will advance Ontario's Innovation Agenda by creating the
information infrastructure required to support 21st century knowledge
economy decision-making, and by engaging the community to use this "open
information" to strengthen innovation in the region.

The premise of this initiative is simple: By sharing and integrating
disparate sets of data -- often collected in institutional silos -- from
government, academia as well as the private and non-profit sectors, we
will better understand the unique strengths, opportunities and needs of
our communities and can more effectively work together to build vibrant,
productive regional innovation economies.

Successful communities around the world increasingly rely on the
information and insights garnered from of a wide range of sources,
including civic organizations, businesses, academic institutions,
non-profits and governments, among others. Significant amounts of data
are collected by these organizations in the course of their work.  The
aggregation of this data will create a rich virtual information hub that
can be accessed by various community stakeholders to make more timely
and better decisions on topics ranging from urban planning to drivers of
economic development. Different models of these open data platforms are
in development elsewhere; there is a unique opportunity for Ontario to
become a leader in this arena, given the strong innovation network that
is being developed across the Province.

As an example, the ReSRC may specifically focus on the role of high
growth firms in the region, given their critical contribution to new job
creation.  In this case, the hub will integrate relevant data sources
and engage entrepreneurs and stakeholders working in/with these firms,
in an effort to shed light on the following questions:  Where are the
high growth firms located? What sectors are they in?  How old are these
firms?  Where do the employees who work in these firms live?  How do
they get to work?  What is their education?  How do the high growth
firms collaborate with academic institutions in the region?  What other
firms in the region do the high growth firms rely on or support?  Which
public policy or program instruments are particularly effective in
supporting the growth of these firms, or hinder their progress?  How can
we do more of what works, to create more high growth firms in the
region?  What barriers need to be removed?

We believe the time is right for Ontario to take a strong leadership
position in the provisioning of open data to foster community leadership
and collaboration.  This initiative will involve the creation of the
inaugural ReSRC, which includes the identification and aggregation of
disparate data sources, sourcing a data management infrastructure, and
developing an online community engagement portal.  The small core ReSRC
team will work closely with a range of partners -- the success of the
initiative will depend on the productive collaboration with stakeholders
in different related sectors.  An Advisory Board, with representation of
key partners, will meet regularly to provide strategic guidance, extend
networks, and share expertise.

The qualified candidate for this exciting position will have strong
skills and demonstrated experience in project management, open data /
information management, data warehousing and integration, community
engagement, IP policy / negotiations, and contract management. 
Outstanding communication skills and ability to lead in a collaborative
environment are critical attributes.
