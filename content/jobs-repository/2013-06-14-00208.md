How would you assist researchers with the acquisition, discovery and
navigation of available economic and financial data?
INET@Oxford and the Oxford-Man Institute conduct data- intensive
research on economic and financial systems.
We are seeking a Data Officer to source, maintain and update a wide
range of data sets from an equally diverse range of providers from data
in the public domain, data from commercial sources, and proprietary data
held by other institutions and individuals.
  
Proactively supporting researchers in both groups, the Data Officer will
be skilled in all aspects of data management, have a clear understanding
of relational databases and the ability to prepare data for academic
analysis. Your tasks will include sourcing and maintaining new data
sets, updating existing data catalogues, ensuring compliance with data
licences, preparing data for analysis and assisting in the
interpretation of that data.
Excellent Excel and VBA skills and familiarity with mathematical and
econometric software (eViews, SPSS, SAS) are desirable.
