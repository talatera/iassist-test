The Libraries has been providing data management services to campus for
the past three years with the Data Curation Librarian providing the
majority of the support. The Libraries has made good progress on
offering these services, but is limited by how much support can be
provided by less than 1 FTE devoted to data management services. Last
year the Research Computing Governance Committee (RCGC) Data Management
and Curation Subcommittee administered a data management and curation
survey that was sent to faculty, researchers, staff, and graduate
students to discover their data storage, data management, and curation
needs. Results indicated a need for data management workshops, active
data management support, and a local (UA) data repository. As a result,
the Subcommittee developed a Data Management and Data Publication and
Curation (DMDC) Pilot proposal. The proposal was supported by RCGC and
received funding from the RCGC sponsors in the fall of 2015.

This position will serve two major purposes: 1) as part of the DMDC
Pilot, provide support for five research projects (chemical engineering
and education, cancer research, public health, entomology, and ecology)
participating in the pilot by developing templates, workflows etc.,
assisting in setting up data management technology and tools, and
providing metadata support; and 2) work with the data curation librarian
to expand data management and curation services and programs focusing on
reaching out to campus to provide a variety of educational support for
data management and data curation.

The incumbent will continue to develop their research competencies by
working with the research groups on data management technology and tools
(as part of the pilot); and by developing advanced data management
workshops.
