Georgia State University Library seeks an innovative, collegial and
forward-thinking manager and data professional to lead the newly-created
Research Data Services Team. As part of the Research and Engagement
Department, the Team Leader helps define new services and develop
programs for the evolving area of data services within an agile and
collaborative research library environment, and is the direct supervisor
for 4-6 library faculty and content specialists, serving as their
primary mentor and advocate.

The Team Leader facilitates library support of interdisciplinary data
services and projects involving quantitative, qualitative, business and
spatial/GIS data in collaboration with faculty, staff and students from
across the university. The Team Leader encourages greater library
collaborations with and advises campus researchers across the entire
research lifecycle, including identifying, acquiring, and using unique
data sets, using data analysis software (SPSS, NVivo, etc.), data
management, data storage, and the publication, sharing, and reuse of
research data.

Big data analytics has been identified as major focus at Georgia State
(e.g., Institute for Insight), and increased use of data visualization
software and GIS are transforming multiple disciplines, especially in
understanding the complex challenges of cities. The successful candidate
will be able to work successfully with campus partners across multiple
colleges to further research and student learning in these key areas.
The Team Leader may also serve as the subject liaison for one or more
academic departments. The successful candidate will serve as member of
the library faculty, hold faculty rank, and be expected to engage in
service and scholarly activities.
