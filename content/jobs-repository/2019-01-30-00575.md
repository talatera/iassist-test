The Geographic Information Science (GIS) Specialist plays a critical
role in the development, growth, and stability of the University
Library's geospatial program. The GIS Specialist has interests in all
facets of a geospatial program--hardware, software, data access, and
user services--and the ability to support and move forward the
Library's geospatial endeavors in all of these areas. From a strong
technical foundation, the GIS Specialist is adept at and enthusiastic
about communicating technical information to non-technical users. GIS
consultation and assistance is provided primarily in the Scholarly

with Scholarly Commons personnel and campus partners, as well as
personnel throughout the library, to meet the campus's needs for
geospatial services, collections, and infrastructure. Key collaborators
in the library will be the Map Librarian, Library Information Technology
staff, metadata librarians, Research Data Service, and Digitization
Services.
