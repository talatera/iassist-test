The University of Virginia Library establishes deep connections with
faculty and students in ways that foster excellence in current and
emerging research, scholarship, teaching and learning. The Social
Science Librarian will support that mission by collaborating with a
cohort of social science, science and engineering, and data librarians
to: support research and teaching in the social and behavioral sciences;
advance and promote existing services to enhance research across the
lifecycle and across all levels of research expertise; identify emerging
needs in these fields and envision new services in response; and develop
and strengthen relationships between the library, faculty and students,
and other centers on campus, positioning the library as a key partner.
