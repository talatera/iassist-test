The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is a new
organization at the University of Washington. Its mission is to monitor
global health conditions and health systems, as well as to evaluate
interventions, initiatives, and reforms. It also will build an audience
of interested policymakers, researchers, donors, and other decision
makers in health who are interested in learning more about how to apply,
use, and derive better evidence in global health.

IHME has an outstanding opportunity for a Content Manager to play a
leading role in the development of a data platform for internal data
management, data dissemination, and data sharing with other
organizations engaged in Global Health. The Content Manager will be
responsible for all aspects of the management, archiving and retrieval
of data, data sets and related content at IHME. The Content Manager will
play an important role in the Institute's mission by putting data at the
fingertips of researchers and providing research results and data sets
to external audiences through the IHME Web site. In addition, the
Content Manager will play a central role in designing and implementing
the necessary IT infrastructure. The Content Manager will report to the
Global Data Bank Director.
