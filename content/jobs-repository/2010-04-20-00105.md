The Data and Support Services Officer will prepare data, documentation
and metadata for addition to the UK Data Archive Secure Data Service
server. The work involves converting data and accompanying documentation
between different software and formats, checking the data and
documentation for both new and existing datasets, adding value to them
by adding/improving the labelling of variables in data files and
creating dataset metadata, including catalogue records and keyword
indexes, according to established procedures. The successful candidate
will liaise with data creators, staff at other Economic and Social Data
Service (ESDS) centres and data users. In addition other data-related
work within the remit of the Secure Data Service may be undertaken as
required.
