The University Library is looking to appoint a highly motivated
individual to the position of Research Data Manager. The successful
candidate will work with colleagues in Research and Innovation and in IT
Services on the development of high quality, innovative research data
management services to support the University of Salford's research
community.

You must have an excellent understanding of issues and technical
challenges related to curation and sharing of research data. You will
also have successfully managed projects, possess excellent communication
skills, and have experience of advocating for cultural change and
driving innovation.

You must have good communication skills, be confident in working with
academic and professional services colleagues, and able to manage your
time and prioritize tasks effectively.

A familiarity with the current UK research environment is also
essential.

The Research Data Manager has responsibility for co-ordinating the
development of a Research Data Management Support Service for the
University of Salford.

 

You will work with colleagues and researchers within and outside the
Library (in particular in ITS and Research and Innovation) to develop
services and infrastructure to support research data management and
sharing. You will ensure that the research data management service meets
the expectations of the university, government, funders, enterprise and
the research community. An essential part of the role will be monitoring
and analysing developments elsewhere in the sector and integrating them,
where appropriate, into the research data service.

 

A proactive approach and collaborative working will be essential. This
role requires a dynamic person that can be an advocate for change and a
driver of cultural development.

    management requirements, benefits and support;

 

-   Provide first line support for enquiries relating to research data
    management and sharing;

 

-   Participate in relevant networks and monitor publications to keep
    abreast of developments in research data management and related
    areas and ensure, where appropriate, these are adopted by the
    University;

 

-   Represent and promote the Library internally and externally
    including delivery of presentations and papers at conferences;

 

-   Ensure the continuing development and growth of all library staff by
    contributing to the Library's programmes for training and
    development;

 

-   Perform any other duties appropriate to the grade as may be required
    by the University Librarian;

 

-   Bring to the attention of managers any matters relating to the
    health and safety of staff, students and visitors;

 

-   Engage with the University's commitment to deliver value for money
    services that optimise the use of resources by maintaining a cost
    conscious approach when undertaking all duties and aspects of the
    role;

 

-   Promote equality and diversity for students and staff and sustain an
    inclusive and supportive study and work environment in accordance
    with University policy; and

 

-   This role detail is a guide to the work you will initially be
    required to undertake.  It may be changed from time to time to meet
    changing circumstances.  It does not form part of your Contract of
    Employment.
