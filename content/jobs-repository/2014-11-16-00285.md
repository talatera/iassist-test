The Research Data Service seeks innovative, collaborative, and
service-oriented professionals for two Data Curation Specialist
positions. The candidates will advance the campus' Research Data Service

with researchers and units to manage, curate, publish, and archive
research data. This is an exciting opportunity to play a pivotal role in
enabling world-class, data-driven research.

Specific areas of activity include but are not limited to:

    quantitative data types and formats including numeric, geospatial,

    recommend potential software and tools for data re-use, management,
    and curation;
-   Assist researchers in preparation and deposition of datasets into
    institutional or discipline-specific repositories

 

The positions will require the ability to identify and prioritize needs,
establish protocols, and creatively problem-solve both independently and
as part of a team.  The candidates will play an important role in the
campus' new Research Data Service at the University Library by
interfacing with campus researchers, data service librarians, and the
