he position is for a Research Systems Analyst which is a
programmer/developer position. However, the candidate needs to have a
fair amount of economic/business/finance background to perform well in
the position. The ideal candidate is a double major in computer science
and economics/finance/statistics. But there are many other combinations
that work well too.

The RSA should be able to work with end user Economists and Financial
Analysts to identify user needs, prototype applications and databases,
and provide excellent customer support. This position integrates an
understanding of financial data and the technology with which they are
maintained.
  
Experience in programming and database management and basic knowledge of
technology concepts and methodologies is required. Experience working
with Linux, SAS, DB2/SQL, PERL, XML, web development skills (such as CGI
scripting or ColdFusion), and relational databases (such as SQL server
and Postgres) is highly desirable. An understanding of financial/
accounting principles and familiarity with the banking industry and Bank
Holding Company structure is desirable.
