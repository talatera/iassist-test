The University of California, Berkeley seeks an enthusiastic,
collaborative, and service-oriented librarian to join a team of
specialists supporting world-class research and teaching in the
engineering and physical sciences through active engagement with
collection development, data and information literacy initiatives,
course-based instruction, individual research assistance, and outreach
to students, faculty and the broader academic community. This position
serves as subject librarian for one or more engineering disciplines, and
takes a leadership role in providing research data lifecycle support
throughout the engineering and physical sciences.

**Responsibilities**

The Science Data & Engineering Librarian provides expert advice and
guidance across the research data lifecycle including data management,
curation, sharing, and visualization to faculty, students, researchers,
and fellow librarians in the engineering and physical sciences. The
librarian develops outreach programs to promote the suite of data
management tools and services available at UC Berkeley. The librarian
creates and provides data and information literacy instruction in the
form of workshops, classroom instruction, online guides, video
tutorials, and other formats as appropriate. The librarian collaborates
with other librarians, library systems staff, and Research IT staff on
our growing Research Data Management program.

The librarian also serves as the selector and liaison for one or more
engineering disciplines. The librarian selects materials in all formats,
manages collections through storage and weeding, and monitors budgets
and approval plans for the assigned subject areas. The librarian also
collaborates with other librarians on campus and within the UC System on
collection decisions for print and electronic resources. The librarian
contributes to reference and instructional services including virtual
reference, consultations, in-person classes, online subject guides, and
other instructional materials.

Reporting to the Head of the Engineering & Physical Sciences Division,
this position will collaborate frequently with colleagues in that
division as well as with colleagues in the Life & Health Sciences
Division and other divisions. The successful candidate will become the
division's knowledge leader for current trends in research data
lifecycle support services and maintain awareness of data and metadata
requirements, practices, and standards as they are adopted by various
funding agencies and research communities.
