The Research Data Curator will support the creation and development of a

Libraries-acquired collections of qualitative data, quantitative data,
text corpora, and software are properly evaluated, structured,
described, and accessioned into the Libraries' digital collections and

University. This position will add value to existing research data
services by tying together in a holistic way Stanford Library's

perspective. This position would actively participate in promoting and
incorporating FAIR data principles into our strategic planning.
