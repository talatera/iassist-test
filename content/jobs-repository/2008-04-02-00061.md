The Arizona State University Libraries seeks a social sciences data
analyst to join its Department of Informatics and Cyberinfrastructure
Services. Reporting to the Cyberinfrastructure Services Manager, the
successful applicant will play a lead role for the University in
developing and managing an archive of quantitative data from local,
state, federal and private sources for use by ASU researchers, their
partners, and Arizona policy makers and analysts in general. The
incumbent will work in a highly collaborative environment and maintain
effective working relationships with ASU's Institute of Social Sciences
Research (ISSR), other ASU centers and research groups that collect or
create numeric data, and organizations outside the University who
compile and make available numeric datasets. Major Duties and
Responsibilities

-   Collaborates with University and external stakeholder communities to
    determine and articulate scope and policies for data collection
-   Identifies sources of quantitative data that represent economic and
    social indicators relevant to the needs of ASU researchers and
    external collaborators, and which are essential to ASU research
    projects, particularly the Arizona Indicators project (
    http://www.asu.edu/indicators/ )
-   Works with faculty teams to determine data acquisition priorities
    for supported projects (Arizona Indicators) and general University
    research needs to assure timely delivery of data
-   Collaborates with informatics specialists at the ASU Libraries and
    the Institute for Social Sciences Research to establish a data
    archiving pipeline for datasets collected by researchers making use
    of ISSR services
-   Collaborates with researchers and informatics specialists in the
    Libraries, the Institute for Social Sciences Research, the High
    Performance Computing Institute, and the University Technology
    Office to establish appropriate models for metadata, data
    representation, and data management within the ASU Digital
    Repository, and to create optimal means for the dissemination of
    datasets (download, visualization, etc.)
-   Reviews source data and validates integrity; normalizes datasets to
    formats amenable to broad dissemination and preservation using an
    appropriate suite of software tools (Stata, SPSS, Excel, DBMSCopy,
    etc.)
-   Using best practices and standards established by the Data
    Documentation Initiative (DDI), prepares metadata for numeric
    datasets to document source of data and to describe datasets;
    compiles and provides codebooks for datasets as needed
-   Collaborates with systems analysts and software engineers to specify
    requirements for workflow tools related to data acquisition and data
    curation

MINOR Duties and Responsibilities

-   Consults with University researchers regarding specialized needs for
    numeric datasets, data formats, or special data analysis
    requirements and provides assistance as appropriate
-   Maintains broad awareness of current trends in data collection and
    organization, data preservation, and numeric data analysis by
    participation in appropriate professional activities and
    contributing to research in the field; collaborates with informatics
    specialists at the ASU Libraries, ISSR and the High Performance
    Computing Institute to implement procedures and technologies that
    assure the long-term sustainability and accessibility of datasets

Relationships

-   Reports to the Cyberinfrastructure Services Manager in the
