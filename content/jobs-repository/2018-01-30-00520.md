Galter Health Sciences Library & Learning Center seeks an innovative and
energetic data professional to support robust data practices and promote
data discoverability in support of the operations of a data index. The
Data Index will be built as part of the recently awarded CTSA Program
Center for Data to Health Coordinating Center (CD2H). The CD2H was
established through a 5-year award from the National Center for
Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and will coalesce and
coordinate informatics activities across the Clinical and Translational
Science Award (CTSA) Program, a network of more than 50 medical research
institutions, to provide collaborative clinical and translational
research infrastructure. A key demonstrator of the data index tool will
be a cross-campus lifespan data initiative at Northwestern University
from the DevSci Institute focusing on developmental sciences across the
lifespan. Working collaboratively with librarians on both campuses,
researchers, and IT teams, this full-time, non-tenured faculty librarian
will lead outreach of the project to the university and engagement of
stakeholders with deposit, management, and preservation of data assets
across interdisciplinary research topics. In cooperation with the Head
of Digital Systems at Galter Library, as well as other relevant faculty
and staff throughout the libraries on both campuses, the successful
applicant will provide leadership and direction on this project that
advances the strategic direction of Northwestern University through
better access and discoverability of data. This position will
participate in secondary assignments based on qualifications, interests,
and need.
