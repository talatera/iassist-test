Reporting to the Assistant Director for Academic Services, you will be
the operational lead and will provide strategic support for the
establishment of the University's sustainable and robust research data
management (RDM) support infrastructure. Working closely with University
RDM stakeholders, particularly the Library, Research and Innovation
Services (R&IS), Corporate Information and Computing Services (CiCS),
Faculties and research centres, and in liaison with the White Rose
university consortium and N8 RDM Directors, you will be responsible for
planning, outreach, resource and policy development to address the data
life cycle needs of researchers and for developing and implementing
strategies that allow key RDM stakeholders to contribute as effectively
as possible to the management and accessibility of the university's
research data outputs.

Educated to postgraduate degree level, you will be able to think
strategically as well as deliver operationally. You will be a confident
communicator and advocate for the benefits of RDM, who enjoys working
with groups and individuals, as well as networking beyond the
University. You will need to be exceptionally well-organised and
proactive, experienced in planning and managing large-scale complex
projects, and will possess excellent communication and diplomacy skills.
