This role offers an exciting opportunity to develop and deliver library
support services to social scientists in the discovery, use and
management of locally created and externally available data.Â  As one of
a team of Subject Consultants, you will also develop world-class online
and print research collections and provide a consultation and enquiry
service, particularly to the Departments of Economics, Sociology, and
Social Policy & Intervention.

  
The successful candidate will have excellent IT and communication
skills, a higher degree in social science or librarianship/information
science, an informed understanding of social science information needs
and uses, and knowledge of legal, policy and ethical frameworks
governing research data and information.
Due to the nature of this post, candidates will be required to undertake
a Disclosure Scotland check as well as a financial background check. The
possession of a criminal record or poor financial background will not
necessarily prevent an applicant from obtaining this post, as all cases
are judged individually according to the nature of the role and
