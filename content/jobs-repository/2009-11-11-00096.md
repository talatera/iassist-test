As a Senior Officer for the Research Data Management Support Services
section at the UK Data Archive, you will be responsible for
co-ordinating a JISC-supported project on research data management for
ESRC data-rich investments. This involves working closely with selected
ESRC Research Centres and Programmes to assess existing research data
management practices; implement and help develop effective data
management planning in research projects; and increase capacity within
research centres through support and training.

You will work proactively with researchers and support staff in ESRC
Research Centres and Programmes to develop good data management
practices, procedures and tools; increase data sharing potential; and
disseminate expertise and findings to the wider academic community.

The post is fixed-term until 31 March 2011 and to start as soon as
possible.
  
Experience of undertaking research and data analysis in the social
sciences, both quantitative and qualitative, are essential; as well as
experience of working in a research team and handling research data.
Good communication, time management and problem solving skills are
equally important. The role requires regular travel within the UK, as
well as short term placements with collaborating research centres to
work pro-actively with centre staff.
