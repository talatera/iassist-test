The University of Arizona Libraries' Office of Digital Innovation and
Stewardship (ODIS) seeks a Specialist, Geographic Information Systems
that will focus on developing and providing support for geographic
information systems (GIS) and geospatial data services by developing
workshops on GIS for campus, working with instructors on integrating
online mapping and visualization into their classes, and responding to
GIS and map related reference questions. In addition, this position will
support and enhance the Spatial Data Explorer (SDE), a geospatial data
portal. The geospatial data portal is a one-stop website for previewing
data, querying data, viewing metadata, downloading data and sharing with
others. This support will include an assessment and evaluation of
long-term sustainability options, identifying enhancements to apply to
the SDE software bundle, working with the Technology, Strategy and
Services (TeSS) department; and working with faculty and graduate
students to identify geospatial data to add to the SDE.
