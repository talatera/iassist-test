Yale's Office of Digital Assets and Infrastructure (ODAI) is seeking a
highly motivated digital information expert to work at the intersection
of digital data, technology, and metadata, in pursuit of innovative
approaches to challenging issues in the discovery of diverse digital
assets, in interoperability across disparate collections, in enhancement
of collaborative scholarly environments, and in development of effective
digital dissemination platforms (see attached position description).

ODAI is charged with developing a digital information management
strategy for Yale and building digital collections and technical
infrastructure in a coordinated and collaborative manner across the
entire campus. Programs include the development and deployment of
large-scale digital asset management systems, long-term preservation
repositories for Yale digital content in all formats, cross-collection
search capabilities to enable discovery of collections hosted by
numerous departments, and many other innovative initiatives (see the
ODAI web site for further information: http://odai.research.yale.edu/).
