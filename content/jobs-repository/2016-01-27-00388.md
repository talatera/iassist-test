The University of California San Diego Library seeks applications from
highly motivated, innovative, collaborative, and service-oriented
professionals to join the Library as our GIS Librarian (Assistant,
Associate or Full Librarian). This position reports to the Program
Director of the Library's Reference and Research Advisory Services
(RRAS).

As the use of geospatial data across academic disciplines and the
broader UC San Diego campus continues to expand, the GIS Librarian plays
a critical role in leading and developing the Library's GIS services
for learning, teaching, and research. GIS is a vital component of RRAS,
and the GIS Librarian is the leader within the UC San Diego Library for
developing, managing and providing geospatial data and services. Since
the position has remained unfilled for a few years, the new GIS
Librarian will have the opportunity to rebuild our GIS services and play
a pivotal role in moving RRAS forward. S/he will apply best practices in
geospatial data management and curation for both preservation and
re-use. S/he will implement cutting-edge web-based technologies for
augmentation, presentation, or manipulation of geospatial data. This
position also supports other activities related to reference and
research advisory services.
