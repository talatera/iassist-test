The Research Systems Analyst uses standard statistical and computer
programming techniques to assist higher-level technical staff in the
implementation, maintenance, and support of automated distributed
processing systems and their components.
  
Experience with relational database software, such as Postgres or mySQL,
is required. Ideally this would include the ability to do some or all of
the following: administer, configure, and update database and database
software; design schemas; develop and troubleshoot SQL code; and provide
technical support to users. A knowledge of Linux (or Unix) is also
required, as are good organizational and written and oral communication
skills. Experience in administering, installing, upgrading, and
configuring software in a networked Linux/Unix and Windows environment
is desirable.
