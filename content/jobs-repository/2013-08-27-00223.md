The MIT Libraries seeks an innovative and process-driven strategic
thinker to provide leadership in the generation and analysis of
collections data, to contribute to a holistic collection development
strategy and to serve as the strategist for the Social Sciences and
Management collections. Through active engagement with publishing and
scholarly communities, the Strategist will cultivate an awareness of
best practices and emerging trends in these areas.  Reporting to the
Head of Collections Strategy and Management (CSM), the successful

designated central funds and prioritize expenditures; and select major
interdisciplinary resources.

with selectors in enhancing collection skills and engage them in a
holistic approach to collections building within the context of
outreach, access, metadata creation, rights management, and curation.

gift funds, and participation in resource development and donor
stewardship particularly the identification and articulation of
collection needs. As Collections Strategist s/he will participate in the
