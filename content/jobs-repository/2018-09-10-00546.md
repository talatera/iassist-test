New York University Libraries is seeking a tenure-track faculty
librarian to support the needs of data-intensive research and teaching
across a wide range of social sciences, humanities, and sciences
disciplines at NYU. This individual works as part of a team to grow and
sustain a rapidly evolving set of services that supports researchers
across the full data lifecycle, including data finding and access;
statistical, geospatial, qualitative, and text data analysis training
and consultation; and data management, preservation, and publication.  

The Data Services Librarian plays a key role in building rich data
collections for the libraries, working in close collaboration with other
specialists to select, acquire, and manage tabular, text-based, and data
materials to support campus research and scholarship in the social
sciences and humanities. This person works in tandem with technologists,
metadata architects, and developers within NYU Libraries to maintain and
improve systems for description, storage, discovery, and access to
tabular, spatial, and text-corpus data. 

This position works to promulgate awareness of our resources and
services among faculty and students through outreach activities and in
partnership with other providers. The incumbent works closely with
colleagues in Data Services and the Librarian for Geospatial Information
Systems to deliver data-focused instruction, reference, and consultation
activities. Depending upon the background of the candidate, this person
may also serve as liaison librarian to one or more programs or
departments at the University, selecting materials and providing
services to support the research and teaching of faculty, graduate, and
undergraduate students in said areas. 

The Data Services Librarian participates in library-wide committees,
activities, and special projects, especially those involving new
technologies and data. The incumbent will develop and maintain awareness
of data-centered initiatives across the sciences, attending professional
meetings, workshops and conferences for training and continuing
professional development. The Data Services Librarian is based in the
NYU Data Services, a joint service of the NYU Libraries and NYU Research
Technology. This position reports to the Head of Specialized Research
Services and Data Services in the Collections and Research Services
Division, and operates in close coordination with the Digital
Scholarship Services and the Digital Library Technology Services group.

At the Division of Libraries, we are proud of our organizational culture
and we are committed to building and sustaining a diverse, inclusive,
and equitable organization that supports a sense of belonging for the
staff and communities we serve. For more about our values, see
