The Research Data Workflows Specialist will advance the library's
mission to create and sustain data services for the c­ampus that support
the mission of the University of Michigan researchers through [Research
Data Services (RDS)](http://www.lib.umich.edu/research-data-services), a
new and growing initiative that will build the next generation of data
curation systems. A key focus of this position will be to understand and
connect with the various disciplinary workflows on campus in order to
inform the development of our technical infrastructure and data
services.

The Research Data Workflows Specialist position is centered on
understanding and implementing solutions around researcher workflow
needs with regard to data intake, transfer, dissemination, and curation.
In partnership with library and campus stakeholders, this position will
be responsible for developing an understanding of existing technical
infrastructures, tools, and workflows (such as
through [Globus](https://www.globus.org/), [Hydra ](https://projecthydra.org/)and [Fedora](http://fedorarepository.org/))
used by researchers at the university and how these workflows could be
applied, augmented or reimagined to ensure or enhance the value of
research data to disciplinary communities or the general public. The
successful candidate will provide expert consultation and instruction on
the technical aspects of data management and curation to research
communities. The incumbent will connect the library to the University's
data science initiatives, build relationships with data science
practitioners and personnel who provide support, and serve as the
liaison to the [Michigan Institute for Data Science
(MIDAS)](http://midas.umich.edu/).
