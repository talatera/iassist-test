The University of Surrey is looking for someone to join the Library and
Learning Services' "Open Research" group to take the lead in
establishing, and then supporting, the University's 'research data
management and preservation service'.  In a context in which open access
to research data is being championed by government and research funders,
this important role will offer consultation and technical support to
researchers in the planning, management, publishing and preserving of
their datasets.  Working alongside professional colleagues in an
established library team dedicated to supporting the scholarly
communication activity of the University, you will build on the work
already undertaken, to develop and grow a researcher-friendly advocacy
and support service.

In this dynamic and solution-focussed environment, you should be able to
work flexibly and in a self-directed manner.  Juggling multiple
activities and being able to meet deadlines, whilst remaining responsive
to researchers, will be key qualities for the role.  Excellent
communication skills are equally essential.
  
-   A degree (or equivalent qualification) or significant relevant
    professional experience gained through working in a library,
    archive, IT or research support environment, whether in the private
    or public sector.
-   Experience of working in data management or liaison work in an
    academic or research institution, or experience in research
    involving significant work with data or software, would be
    particularly advantageous.
