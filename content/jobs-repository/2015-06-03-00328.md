The University of Alberta Libraries, with a long tradition of
technological innovation and service excellence, seeks a dynamic and
engaged professional for an 18 month contract to work as a member of a
project team to create rich metadata for discovery, access, citation,
and long-term preservation of historical and contemporary collections of
maternal, infant, child and youth health research data.

"Bridging the Research Data Divide: Rethinking Long-term Value and
Access for Historical and Contemporary Maternal, Infant and Child
Research", a grant-funded collaboration between the Libraries and
Harvard University's Center for the History of Medicine (CHoM), seeks to
bring temporal depth in laying the groundwork for value-added long-term
access to and preservation of both collections, while protecting the
privacy of research participants and communities of study.

Reporting to the Metadata Coordinator, and working as a part of a small
team located at Uof A and Harvard, the successful candidate will work
with researchers to analyze, assess and select relevant metadata
standards; perform metadata mapping and data integration activities
using open source tools; implement current best practices regarding
sensitive health metadata (and data); work with UAL and Countway staff
to expose and preserve project metadata and data; supervise and review
the work of the UAL Data Curation Assistant; develop guidelines for
metadata creation and enhancement by UAL project staff; develop and
maintain internal / external project documentation and communication;
contribute to conference presentations and articles about the project.
  
Qualifications include a Master's degree in Library and Information
Studies from an ALA accredited institution; experience working with
metadata and/or data in the health sciences or related field. Experience
with developing, applying and managing metadata schemas and controlled
vocabularies or other relevant complex data integration and analysis
activities and/or familiarity with conventions and standards within the
health sciences or related field would be an asset. Applicants must
possess excellent communication and interpersonal skills; the ability to
take initiative and work independently; comfort with learning new tools
and software; interest in collaborating on project presentations and
papers.
