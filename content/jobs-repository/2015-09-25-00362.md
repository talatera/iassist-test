This opening is a unique opportunity for an energetic and
forward-looking University Librarian to lead the continued evolution of
a modern academic library. Come to Brock to make a difference; to build
teams, culture, relationships, and capacity. Join us, an innovative team
of librarians and library staff, in this exciting period of change.

Reporting to the Provost and Vice-President, Academic, the University
Librarian is a member of the Senior Administrative Council, and provides
the vision, strategic leadership, and oversight of the Library as it
continues to fulfill its role as an essential partner in the teaching,
learning and research endeavours of the Brock community.

The University library system includes the James A. Gibson Library, Map,
Data & GIS Library, and Special Collections and Archives. With a staff
of 52 of whom 20 are professional librarians, and an annual budget of
approximately $8 million, the Library provides services and resources
to support 594 faculty and over 18,000 students in seven Faculties.

The University Librarian is integral to the continued commitment of
cultivating relationships, and represents the Library both internally
and externally in organizations to which it belongs, such as the Ontario
Council of University Libraries (OCUL), Canadian Association of Research
Libraries (CARL), the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN), and,
the Centre for Research Libraries (CRL). A collaborative leader with
excellent communication and team-building skills, the University
Librarian will articulate, implement and promote a vision for a 21st
century library, with an emphasis on advancing digital initiatives and
services.
