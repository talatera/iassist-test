The New York University Libraries seeks a librarian to plan and develop
services to meet scholars' needs for consultation and assistance with
research data management. This position works as a member of the NYU
Data Services, consulting with faculty, graduate students, and other
researchers on data management planning and data curation activities;
developing instructional programming and documentation to support
scholars in this area; and working with technical colleagues in NYU's IT
organization and the Digital Library Technology Services group (which is
responsible for the libraries' repository and digitization
infrastructures) to adapt, design, and develop tools and repository
services for storing and sharing research data. The successful candidate
will demonstrate a clear vision of the services, infrastructure, and
skills required to provide high quality assistance to our researchers.

This new position will play a key role in NYU's mission by establishing
strong collaborative relationships with researchers, and developing,
delivering, and promoting new services in response to their rapidly
expanding needs in data management. The position will be responsible for
spearheading the consultation and instructional services in this area by
developing a flexible curriculum on data management; meeting with
researchers in individual and group settings to consult on projects,
planning, and best practices; exploring and piloting base-line services
in curation practices and techniques; and creating documentation and
guidelines related to scholars' emerging data management needs. Other
activities may include ongoing assessment and monitoring of researcher
needs, proactive development of knowledge and expertise in data
management issues across disciplines and domains, and advising
researchers on how to meet the data management and open data
requirements of publishers and federal funding agencies. This individual
will be central to efforts to design appropriate data repository and
storage infrastructure for researchers across the University.
