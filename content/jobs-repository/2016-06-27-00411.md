The Social Science Data Archive (SSDA), in operation since 1961, is a
recognized leader in the management of quantitative social science
research data and represents UCLA in local, state, national and
international professional communities. The mission of the Social
Science Data Archive has been, and continues to be, to provide a
foundation for social science research with faculty support throughout
an entire research project involving original data collection or the
reuse of publicly available studies. Data Archive staff work in
partnerships with researchers to provide a collaborative environment
where the focus is on understanding the nature and scope of research
approach and management of research output throughout the entire life
cycle of the project.

The Social Science Data Archive is heavily focused on the long term
management of unique research data gathered using quantitative methods.
This includes providing Data Quality Review, and processes at each step
of the archival process, including appraisal, ingest, metadata
preparation, development of discovery and access tools, online analysis,
and ensuring long term usability.

Instructional support, especially support that links research with
instruction, is also a mainstay of operations. The Social Science Data
Archive is one of the key support components in those disciplines that
provide instruction in research methods, survey design and methods,
statistics, and data analysis. Throughout the campus, data provided by
the Archive is used by faculty in courses to transmit pedagogy,
illustrate theory and develop understanding of social, political,
demographic, economic, geographic and historical trends and issues.
