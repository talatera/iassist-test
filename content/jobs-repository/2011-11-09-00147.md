We are seeking to appoint a Data and Services Developer to join the
Application Development and Maintenance section of the UK Data
Archive.Â The section provides support for the critical needs of the
other divisions in the UK Data Archive, developing, maintaining and
updating internal and external systems which are in everyday use. We
have recently adopted a Continuous Integration and Testing approach to
software development, using a suite of well know source code management,
scripting, build and testing tools and all members of the section use
Continuous Integration and Testing on a daily basis.

The UK Data Archive is in the process of redeveloping a number of its
legacy applications, using new processes, tools and architectures. The
post holder will be part of a small team of developers that is
responsible for the design and implementation of new Dot Net
applications, plus the maintenance and eventual migration to the Data
Archive's Service Oriented Architecture of legacy applications.
  
Among other skills and experience the successful candidate will be a
graduate in a computing related discipline and have experience of using
Dot NET, Web Services, relational databases and software development
tools in a production environment.
