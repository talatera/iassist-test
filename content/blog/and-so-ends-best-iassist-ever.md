And another conference has passed. It's so sad to think that it will be
another year before we get together again but at least we can play
virtually on our lists, this blog and maybe even in SecondLife! I'm
still trying to round up more conference reports but in the meantime,
here's the official conference song lyrics. Sing to the tune of The
Band's song "The Weight"

In case the tune doesn't come to mind immediately, [here's a clip on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYQWCB4rkDI "The Weight") from
the movie "The Last Waltz". Hopefully we'll be able to scare up a
video of our own "Choral Memory Action Group" performance. Kudos to
composer and Action Group leader Melanie Wright for another fitting
closing tune!

Pulled into Frisco, was feeling 'bout half past dead Metadata schemas
circling round my head Version 3 will fix that, the DDI man said Come to
IASSIST with me, and at least you'll be well fed!

Chorus
Oh the Tech of Data Will set the data freeeee It's the tech of Data And
(and and and) IASSIST (IASSIST) is the place to be

At the AC meeting, we talked of strategy And the workshops, 8 in all,
took over the library Are you now or have ever been a cheese-eating
monkey? It's just amazing what you can do with version 3

Chorus

Plenary speaker, was she Catherine or was she Jo? All we know for
certain is Steve's her baby bro Lizza only talked to Tom: fellow data
geeks, you know And in New Zealand it's the sheep that run the show.

Mash-ups are mashtastic, may the data be with you Who's the guy with
the mohawk? oh it's Walter and he's blue! Ann Snoodle's got a
t-shirt, and look, there's SusieQue Welcome SecondLifers to the crazy
data crew

Chorus

Keep it simple stupid, whatcha need a BMW for? Arofan pushed SDMX and
was greeted with a snore And the Finns asked will you need me, when I'm
64? Tried to make the 8-ball fall, and they almost broke the floor!

Torturing nurses with data can really be a blast And the Business
Meeting has never gone so fast Don't let Marilyn near it, if you want
your machine to last Does that make Ekke Scrooge, Bo, if you're the
ghost of Christmas past?

Chorus

Banquet drumming wowed us, baby Taiko high five dude Potato-tinis and
lots of other crazy food [is that port or pork?] From Johnny Cash to
Brick House, the band got us in the mood Dual Turkey sessions meant we
got our dose of crude

Now it's nearly over, nearly time to say goodbye Ron, you've been so
special, the standard you set is high San and Ellie can't be beat,
though Bo and Kate will try And we'll see you all next year, when to
Finland we will fly!

Oh the tech of data Will set the data freeeee It's the tech of data and
(and and and) IASSIST (IASSIST) is the place to be
