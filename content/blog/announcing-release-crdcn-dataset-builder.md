The Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN) is pleased to announce
the release of the CRDCN Dataset Builder.

In collaboration with Statistics Canada and Metadata Technology North
America, the Dataset Builder allows researchers working (or intending to
work) in a Canadian RDC the ability to browse, search for and select
variables in the Statistics Canada surveys currently housed in the
RDCs. 

Utilizing DDI Lifecycle metadata, the Dataset Builder allows researchers
to find and select variables, as well as produce SAS, SPSS or Stata
syntax to help read in and format the variables, and produce customized
documentation (Layout and Codebooks) for the dataset they create using
the app. 

A one-page installation, setup and use guide can be found at this link,
with a link to more descriptive documentation if
necessary: [docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com/document/d/135Eq2fwVRtlMdENpQjmZe5Zjm1OFGImCxtyWeV_7sdI)

The application is open-source software, so please contact Metadata
Technology NA if you're interested in contracting them to customize
this application for your own organization.

Please contact Dave Haans (dave.haans@utoronto.ca) for more
information.
