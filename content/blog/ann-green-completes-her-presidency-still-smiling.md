Ann Green completed her second term as President of IASSIST during the
conference in Edinburgh.

![Ann Green](/img/blog/ann-green.jpg "Ann Green")

A long-standing
member of IASSIST, Ann served as Vice-President from 1997 to 2001 before
serving as President from 2001 to 2005. She has been a excellent leader
achieving many accomplishments during her tenure. She brought in a new
strategic planning process into 2003, which resulted in a [Strategic
Plan](/file/about/strategic_plan_june2004.pdf) released
in May 2004. This Plan is now being integrated into the directions of
our Standing Committees and Action Groups. During her two terms, IASSIST
held four of its finest conferences in the cities of Storrs, Ottawa,
Madison and Edinburgh. Under Ann's leadership, IASSIST continued its
outreach to build relationships with the staff in new national data
archives. IASSIST's firm commitment to the development of the Data
Documentation Initiative is a tribute to the founding role Ann played in
the formation of the DDI standard.

Ann served on the ICPSR Council and as the Chair of the ICPSR Council
during this same time period. We were pleased to share Ann with the
ICPSR but remind everyone that her heart belongs with us IASSISTers.

Thanks, Ann! Your intellect, vision and humour have been an inspiration
to us all!
