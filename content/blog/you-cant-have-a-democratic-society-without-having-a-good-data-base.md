### Janet L. Norwood, former US Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, dies

On the passing of this iconic defender of the neutrality of public data,
I am struck how important [Janet
Norwood](http://beta.bls.gov/labs/blogs/2015/03/31/statement-by-bls-commissioner-erica-l-groshen-on-the-passing-of-former-commissioner-janet-norwood/)
was to establishing a sound path for data advocacy as well as reminded
of how necessary it is to have *continuous* education about this topic. 
In fact, swimming in ready-access to data as we are today, it's
especially important that we, as data professionals, remain alert to and
defend a couple of aphorisms:

-   Stay true to the facts; Zealously *retain non-partisan associations*
    in the recording of all public data, analyses and reporting.
-   "[Use it for GOOD -- never for
    EVIL](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/;)" [](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/)Encourage
    the *use of public data for the public good.*

 In reviewing the memorials to Janet Norwood, a couple of succinct
statments seem apt (in addition to the heading of this post).
