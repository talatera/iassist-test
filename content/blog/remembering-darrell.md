On Saturday, April 27, 2019, IASSIST and the broader data professional's
community lost a valued colleague and friend, Darrell Donakowski. The
IASSIST organization mourns his untimely death and wishes to recognize
the significant contributions he made to the data community over the
course of his career.

Friends and family have created a
scholarship at the University of Michigan-Dearborn in his memory.  At
the suggestion of the several members and with the approval of the
Administrative Committee, IASSIST has contributed $1000 to the
scholarship to recognize the numerous contributions Darrell made to the
data community right up to the time of his premature passing.

Darrell worked as a project manager in the Collection Development Unit
at ICPSR and later served as the Director of Studies of the American
National Election Studies (ANES). He was strongly engaged with IASSIST
and with a broader data community through ICPSR and ANES.  He greatly
enriched those organizations by bringing together data professionals and
archives through efforts such as Data-PASS.

Darrell made prominent scholarly contributions to IASSIST through
multiple publications, web postings and presentations.  He was a
long-time active member who regularly attended and readily participated
in the annual conference. In addition, Darrell was an enthusiastic and
dedicated volunteer in the Dearborn, Michigan political community, and
was generally known as a kind-hearted and generous soul. 

The IASSIST community hopes that the scholarship will help remember
Darrell's contributions and help encourage others to follow his
example.  He will be greatly missed.
