This is a truly fascinating set of events unfurling in Canada.   I
thought I would add a bit (in too many words) for those of you who
don't have the pleasure of Canadian media outlets. J

Parliament recently resumed and there have been a number of significant
issues, like abolishing the LONG Gun Registry,  G8/G20 spending and a
new Governor General who happens to be a former University President.  
Still, the LONG form census continues to make headlines -- do you notice
a theme around abolishing programs with the word LONG in them? The
opposition has been bringing the census issue up in the house, and there
is a private members bill to look at adding the requirement for a long
form census to the Statistics Act.   There has also been a challenge to
the census decision, focused on Francophone language rights.  All very
interesting, in and of themselves.

The last two days have seen our National news (
[http://cbc.ca](http://cbc.ca/) ) once again make the Census the lead
story on their evening broadcast.  They have basically called into
question the numerous statements from the Government around the massive
number of complaints they have received.   The government has
continually promoted the notion that Canadians consider the long form an
invasion of privacy.   In addition they stress that the public does not
 feel it is appropriate to go to jail for not filling out the census. 
The favourite line of the current government is that: "... it  does not
think it is appropriate that we put people in jail for not telling us
how many rooms they have in their house ...".  This is a clearly
distorted statement, but it might play to a certain part of the
community.   

One Minister went as far as to say  that they  received 1000's of
complaints a day about these two issues during the last census  (
<http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/10/04/census-bernier-complaints-documents.html>
). This has always seemed like a fairly absurd statement, especially
when you consider this was the minister who was previously put in the
penalty box for leaving classified briefing notes at his girlfriends
house, who happened to have biker ties.  Throughout this, the government
has never shown evidence of this information and Stats Can says they
have not seen these complaints.  There was one small twist, that during
the 2006 census there was concern about Stats Can using a US firm to do
some of the data entry.  But the issue of intrusiveness is very
different.

This gave the opposition some ammunition and they have been determined
in their attacks in and out of the house.  This has lead to the
government minimizing their statements on the extent of the complaints
and saying that even if  ONE person complains they have an obligation to
address those concerns.   I can't wait to tell them that I am concerned
that my taxes are too high.  In reality they seem to be moving towards
this simply being an ideological issue around the size of government.  
There is lots of engaging  discussion on that.

The census issue was also big enough to make Rick Mercers Rant this week
(<http://www.youtube.com/mercerreport#p/u/2/l3zJ26SNT3g> ) .  I am not
sure how I would classify this show to non-Canadians.  It is not comedy,
but it is funny.  It is not current affairs, but it touches on news,
especially political news.   The segment is not really on the census,
but it uses it for the basis of an argument and highlights the dilemma,
which is WHY did they do this.    We end up still asking questions, the
answers will be less reliable and it will cost more money.

It is the WHY part that is probably more fascinating than just killing
the long form.  The further we enter into the mandate of the current
government the more difficulty some people are having in understanding
what their vision and objectives really are.  Acts, like killing the
Long Form, seem to come out of left field and don't seem to be linked to
a bigger picture.... Although, there are people who would argue
otherwise it is not generally apparent.

It is fun times here, and if you are into data, then you are in the
middle of this one.  I don't think it is over yet. Could an election be
fought on it - it would be a shame if it was, but people are not letting
go of the issue.  At the end of the day I am afraid the government has
undermined some of the trust in the census process and Stats Can, and we
will not get back too the lofty participation rates we enjoyed in the
past.   Check out http://datalibre.cafor updates.
