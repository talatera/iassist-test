Dear Friends,

The IASSIST Communications Committee is very happy to announce that the
back issues of IQ -- ALL of the back issues, back to 1976 -- are now
available on the IASSIST web site.  

In the left sidebar where you are
able to select from a few back issues, you may recall there is a link at
the bottom to [More](http://iassistdata.org/iq/back-issues/new) issues.

 That link can now transport you back to the early days of the
association.  Older issues are wonderful to peruse, offering a window
into how far we've come and at the same time putting in perspective the
many on-going issues with which we're still grappling, all these years
later.  Please take a moment to take a walk down memory lane and reflect
on the past and future of IASSIST.  And please congratulate Robin Rice
and Harrison Dekker for all their work in getting these issues online.

All the Best,

Michele Hayslett

For the Communications Committee
