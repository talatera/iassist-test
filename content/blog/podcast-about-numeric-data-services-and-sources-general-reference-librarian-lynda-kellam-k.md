Lynda Kellam & Katharin Peter, two IASSIST members, recently published
their book on how to be a data librarian:

Kellam, L. M., & Peter, K. (2011). [*Numeric data services and sources
for the general reference
librarian*](http://www.amazon.com/Numeric-Services-Sources-Reference-Librarian/dp/1843345803).
Oxford: Chandos Publishing. 

Earlier this summer, Lynda [discussed the book, data, data literacy and
instruction](http://adlibinstruction.blogspot.com/2011/07/episode-28-she-got-data.html)
with the folks at "Adventures in Library Instruction".

Highly recommended!
