Two sessions at the Edinburgh conference helped formulate in my mind
some concerns that I have about the future of data archives. Together,
the plenary session in which John Curtice described his research about
postmodern values and Session G3 on Transforming Data Archives unified
for me (i) ideas about anti-institutional values expressed in
postmodernism and (ii) current organizational threats to data archives.

I have been troubled by the struggles we have confronted in Canada to
establish a national institution to preserve data. I am convinced that
an impediment to our success is directly related to a sentiment of
anti-institutionalism that exists in conjunction with the technology of
the Internet. This has led me to write an essay in which I have
constructed an argument exposing the anti-institutional values exhibited
in the Internet and the threat that they pose to data archives. As an
example, I discuss how the concept of "self-archiving" promoted
through digital repositories is a misconceived idea rooted in
postmodernist values of individualism.

I have submitted this essay to the IQ for consideration and have
received in the interim consent to release a [**pre-print
version**](http://datalib.library.ualberta.ca/~humphrey/Postmodern_and_Data.htm)
in conjunction with this entry on IASSIST Communiqu√©. I will propose in
the comments to this entry some possible actions that could become part
of the [IASSIST Strategic
Plan](http://www.iassistdata.org/membership/plan_june2004.pdf) as a line
of defense for data archives.

This entry also tests how we might use the IASSIST blog to discuss
issues that should be addressed in the IASSIST Strategic Plan. Please
join in this debate.
