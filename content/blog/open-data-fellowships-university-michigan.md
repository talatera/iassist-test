Students with research interests in scientific data management, sharing
and reuse have a unique opportunity to participate in the Open Data
fellowship program. Open Data is an Integrative Graduate Education and
Research Traineeship (IGERT) sponsored by NSF. Open Data fellows engage
in a vibrant set of research activities at the University of Michigan in
the conduct of responsible data-intensive science and engineering
involving faculty and doctoral students from SI, Computer Science and
Engineering, Bioinformatics, Materials Science, and Chemical
Engineering.

The Open Data fellowships are designed to build a new community of
practice around open sharing and reuse of scientific data through
inter-disciplinary collaborative research, campus-based seminars and
forums, and travel to research conferences.
