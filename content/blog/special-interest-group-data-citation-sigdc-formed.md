We are pleased to announce the creation of a new Special Interest Group
on Data Citation (SIGDC) to promote awareness of data-related research
and scholarship through data citation. The group is co-chaired by Mary
Vardigan and Michael Witt.

Citing data supports the discovery and reuse of data, leading to better
science through the validation of results. It also recognizes data as an
essential part of the scientific record.Â  SIGDC will share information
about its work through the IASSIST list, the IQ, the IASSIST blog, and
sessions at the IASSIST conference as well as other venues and meetings.

More information can be found on the SIGDC website:
