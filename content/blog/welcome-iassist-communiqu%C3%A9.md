The IASSIST Communiqué is a place for discussions and news about all
aspects of research data and the professionals responsible for
collecting, preserving and providing access to such data. As such, this
site welcomes comments on issues that promote preservation and access to
data as well as material about best practices in data archiving and data
services. While the content of this site does not necessarily represent
official positions of IASSIST, we hope that the ideas in these
discussions will provoke further debate and will eventually lead to
positive outcomes.

 

 

News about IASSIST members and their work is also welcome. This is a
place where IASSISTers should feel comfortable in sharing their
achievements in the life cycle of a data professional.
