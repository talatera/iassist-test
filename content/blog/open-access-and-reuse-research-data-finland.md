In 2006, motivated by the OECD Open Access guidelines, the Finnish
Social Science Data Archive (FSD) carried out an online survey targeting
professors of human sciences, social sciences and behavioural sciences
in Finnish universities. Professors were asked, for example, whether
their department had any guidelines on the preservation of digital
research data. A great and alarming majority (90%) said no. The survey
also charted what actually happens to research data and what are the
barriers to and benefits of open access to research data.

In 2006, motivated by the OECD Open Access guidelines, the Finnish
Social Science Data Archive (FSD) carried out an online survey targeting
professors of human sciences, social sciences and behavioural sciences
in Finnish universities.

Professors were asked, for example, whether their department had any
guidelines on the preservation of digital research data. A great and
alarming majority (90%) said no.

What then happens to research data? Most common practise seems to be
that the data remains in the hand of the original researcher(s). Even if
the data are stored in the department or research insitute, no further
processing nor documentation takes place. FSD's influence could be seen
in social sciences, making archiving at a data archive a bit more
frequent than in other sciences.

The survey also charted barriers to open access. Professors were
concerned about inadvertent misuse of data and consequent mistakes. Of
course, without detailed documentation, data reuse may indeed result in
inaccurate interpretations. Lack of agreements regarding data ownership
and IP rights were also mentioned as barriers, as well as loss of
competitive advantage, IT problems, and confidentiality issues.

On the other hand, the professors saw many benefits in open access to
research data. The most significant was enhancing the diversity of
research designs with the use of archived data. All in all, the benefits
were estimated to be more significant than the barriers. The survey also
showed - not surprisingly - that it is usual to a researcher to have a
positive attitude towards open access in general but a
less-than-enthusiastic one to open access to his/her own data.

The report concludes that from the viewpoint of long-term preservation
and reuse, it is definitely less recommendable to leave the
responsibility for the preservation and dissemination of data to
individual researchers. Changing this practice that still prevails in
Finnish universities and other Finnish research organisations
constitutes one of the key goals in the national implementation of the
OECD Recommendation.
