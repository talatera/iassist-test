A number of U.S. IASSISTers were at the recent American Library
Association Annual Conference in Anaheim, California.  This years
program (finally!) featured a number of data related topics, including
the third meeting of the Association of College & Research Libraries
Numeric and Geospatial Data Interest Group (DIG).  Our discussion
covered topics such as content management systems, data hosting,
collection development for small data, and changing professional roles. 
A full report of the meeting is available at
<http://connect.ala.org/node/182442>.  This group provides a great
opportunity for IASSIST members working in U.S. libraries to meet up for
open discussion while at ALA.  ACRL members can learn more about DIG
[here](http://www.ala.org/acrl/aboutacrl/directoryofleadership/interestgroups/acr-igngdsal).
