Here's another list of highlights from IASSIST2016 which is focusing on
the data revolution. For previous highlights, see
[here](http://www.iassistdata.org/blog/interested-“data-revolution”-and-what-it-means-research-here’s-why-you-should-attend-iassist201).

### Infrastructure

-   For those of you with an interest in technical infrastructure, the
    University of Applied Sciences [HTW
    Chur](https://www.openconf.org/IASSIST16/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&action=summary.php&id=74)
    will showcase an early protype MMRepo (1 June, 3F), whose function
    is to store qualitative and quantitative data into one big data
    repository.

<!-- -->

-   The [UK Data
    Service](https://www.openconf.org/IASSIST16/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&action=summary.php&id=103)
    will present the following panel "The CESSDA Technical Framework -
    what is it and why is it needed?", which elaborates how the CESSDA
    Research Infrastructure should have modern data curation techniques
    rooted in sophisticated IT capabilities at its core, in order to
    better serve its community.

<!-- -->

-   If you have been wondering about the various operational components
    and the associated technology counterparts involved with running a
    data science repository, then the presentation by
    [ICPSR](https://www.openconf.org/IASSIST16/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&action=summary.php&id=117)
    is for you. Participants in that panel will leave with an
    understanding of how the Archonnex Architecture at ICPSR is
    strengthening the data services offered to new researchers and much
    more.

### Data processing

Be sure to check out the aforementioned infrastructure offerings if
you're interested in data processing, but also check out a half-day
workshop on 31 May, "Text Processing with Regular Expressions,"
presented by Harrison Dekker, UC Berkeley, that will help you learn
regular expression syntax and how to use it in R, Python, and on the
command line. The workshop will be example-driven.

### Data visualisation {#data-visualisation dir="ltr"}

If you are comfortable working with quantitative data and are familiar
with the R tool for statistical computing and want to learn how to
create a variety of visualisations, then the workshop by the University
of Minnesota on 31 May is for you. It will introduce the logic behind
ggplot2 and give participants hands-on experience creating data
visualizations with this package. This session will also introduce
participants to related tools for creating interactive graphics from
this syntax.

### Programming

-   If you're interesting in programming there's a full-day Intro to
    Python for Data Wrangling workshop on 31 May, led by Tim Dennis, UC
    San Diego,  that will provide tools to use scientific notebooks in
    the cloud, write basic Python programs, integrate disparate csv
    files and more.

<!-- -->

-   Also, the aforementioned Regular Expressions workshop also on 31 May
    will offer  in-workshop opportunities  to working with real data and
    perform representative data cleaning and validation operations in
    multiple languages.

### Research data management

-   Get a behind-the-scenes look at data management and see how an
    organization such as the Odum Institute manages its archiving
    workflows, head to "Automating Archive Policy Enforcement using
    Dataverse and iRODS" on 31 May with presenters from the UNC Odom
    Institute, UNC Chapel Hill. 'Participants will see machine
    actionable rules in practice and be introduced to an environment
    where written policies can be expressed in ways an archive can
    automate their enforcement.

<!-- -->

-   Another good half-day workshop, targeted to for people tasked with
    teaching good research data management practices to researchers is
     "Teaching Research Data Management Skills Using Resources and
    Scenarios Based on Real Data," 31 May, with presenters from ICPSR,
    the UK Data Archive and FORS. The organisers of this workshop will
    showcase recent examples of how they have developed teaching
    resources for hands-on-training, and will talk about successes and
    failures in this regard.

<!-- -->

-   The Technical Data Infrastructure Frameworks session on 1 June will
    have opportunities to get a better understanding of  the
    fast-changing research data management environment, too, with
    presentations on [The Cessda Technical Framework - What Is It And
    Why Is It
    Needed?](https://www.openconf.org/IASSIST16/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&action=summary.php&id=103);
    [Mmrepo - Storing Qualitative And Quantitative Data Into One Big
    Data
    Repository;](https://www.openconf.org/IASSIST16/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&action=summary.php&id=74)
    and [Archonnex at ICPSR - Data Science Management For
    All](https://www.openconf.org/IASSIST16/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&action=summary.php&id=117).
