Late last year, a colleague at [Innovations for Poverty
Action](http://www.poverty-action.org/), Stephanie Wykstra, and I
started having conversations about reuse of open data and what we do and
don't know about the re-use of existing data sets, particularly which
data sets and how they are used.  We are also interested in the specific
challenges researchers face as they try to re-use data sets collected
for other research purposes.  Stephanie and I would like to start
filling this gap so we are putting out a call for case studies.

If you have re-used data for your own research (or know someone else who
has), we would love to hear about it! The parameters and further details
for the call can be found in this blog post on the Mozilla Science Lab
blog:
[https://www.mozillascience.org/share-your-story](https://www.mozillascience.org/share-your-story).

We are particularly interested in stories of data re-use that are not
from large-scale surveys or census data sets as there are many examples
of those.  We are also aware of some instances where large data
repositories collect information on use of data sets housed in their
collections (see [ICPSR Bibliography of Data-related
Literature](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/citations/index.jsp)
and [UK Data
Archive](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/use-data/data-in-use)).  While
we will be incorporating some of those cases in our report, we'd like to
hear more about stories that may not be included in those collections.

There is a very simple form at the blog post linked above.  We are
basically interested in:

1) What made the data that you re-used valuable for your own research?

2) What made the data easy or challenging to re-use?

and

3) Your advice to researchers who are sharing their data for re-use.  

The deadline for submitting case studies is **March 10, 2016**.  We will
make all responses publicly available in a report after an analysis of
the responses (with your permission). Depending on funding, we may be
able to sponsor researchers who provide case studies to a workshop on
data re-use.  Please spread this call far and wide to any you think
would be interested in participating.

can provide!
