The UK Research Information Network "has published a
[report](http://www.rin.ac.uk/researchers-discovery-services) on the
behaviour, perceptions and needs of researchers as users of discovery
services."

[Researchers and discovery services Behaviour, perceptions and
needs](http://www.rin.ac.uk/files/Report%20-%20final.pdf) (pdf)

One interesting quote:

> The main uses of all the more general tools (such as Google, other
> forms of general web search and asking colleagues) are for more
> general background information activities. It is, however, worth
> noting that the general tools are also used to locate datasets whereas
> bibliographic tools are not. This suggests that datasets have not yet
> entered the mainstream as far as perceptions of how to locate them and
> that more focused tools are not providing the detail that researchers
> need.
