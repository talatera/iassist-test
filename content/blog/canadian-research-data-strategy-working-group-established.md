Research Data Strategy Working Group Established [http
://cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/media/press/rds_group_e.html](//cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/media/press/rds_group_e.html),
press release, August 12, 2008.

The research process generates huge amounts of data that are an
important part of Canada's scholarly record and hold enormous potential
as an additional discovery and problem-solving tool for researchers.
Unfortunately, Canada has no nationally adopted standards or policies
governing how this data is collected, catalogued, or preserved.

Research Data Strategy Working Group Established [http
://cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/media/press/rds_group_e.html](//cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/media/press/rds_group_e.html),
press release, August 12, 2008.

The research process generates huge amounts of data that are an
important part of Canada's scholarly record and hold enormous potential
as an additional discovery and problem-solving tool for researchers.
Unfortunately, Canada has no nationally adopted standards or policies
governing how this data is collected, catalogued, or preserved.

A new collaborative effort is now underway to address the challenges
surrounding the access and preservation of this data. The Research Data
Strategy (RDS) Working Group
<http://data-donnees.gc.ca/eng/members.html> is a multi-disciplinary
group of universities, institutes, libraries, granting agencies, and
individual researchers with a shared recognition of the pressing need to
deal with Canadian data management issues.

Together, the Working Group is focusing on the necessary actions, next
steps and leadership roles that researchers and institutions can take to
ensure Canada's research data is accessible and usable for current and
future generations of researchers.

To support this effort, the Working Group has launched the Research Data
Canada Web site [http
://data-donnees.gc.ca/eng/index.html](http://data-donnees.gc.ca/eng/index.html)
as a tool to communicate with the broader community and to facilitate
communication within and between three task groups, which have been
formed to explore issues related to policies, funding and research;
infrastructure and services; and capacity (skills, training, and reward
systems).

The RDS Working Group will be convening a consultation around these
issues at a future date to gather input and develop an action plan.
