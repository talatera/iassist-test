The UKDA celebrated its anniversary in style, with a reception at the
Houses of Parliament in London on Wednesday, 10th July (2007), a
forward-looking workshop in its new building at the University of Essex
on the 11th, with a return of some familiar faces who have moved on to
retirement or other fields. See press release at
<http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2007/07/news_ukda.aspx> The occasion
called for reflection on the past, as the news story illuminates:

> "Jointly funded by JISC and the ESRC, the UKDA is now an
> internationally renowned centre of expertise in data acquisition and
> is curator of the UK's largest collection of digital data in the
> social sciences and humanities. But as the booklet highlights, the
> development of the Archive has not always gone smoothly and in the
> early years even its strongest supporters could scarcely have imagined
> how successful it would become.
>
>  
>
> The first major challenge for the Archive was acquiring useful data to
> store - a process that proved much more difficult than expected. Three
> years after it was established, the Archive had only acquired a small
> random collection of surveys and there were only a handful of users.
> The breakthrough came in the 1970s with the acquisition of data
> collected in large government surveys including the General Household
> Survey, the Labour Force Survey, and the Family Expenditure Survey.
> Since then, the Archive's holdings have grown from strength to
> strength and its data are in high demand both nationally and
> internationally."

The Archive staff produced a booklet for the occasion, which is mirrored
in a content-rich anniversary website here
