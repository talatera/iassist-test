Hello - for those who were not able to attend IASSIST 2011 and for those

The QuickTime .mov files are available in a variety of viewing formats:
via desktops, iPhone, iPod, iPad, smartphones.

We have had various and mixed reports on streaming successes. These are
large Video files (each over an Hour in length), so patience is
required.
