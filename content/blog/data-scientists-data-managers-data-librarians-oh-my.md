[The Skills, Role and Career Structure of Data Scientists: An Assessment
of Current Practice and Future
Needs](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/publications/dataskillscareersfinalreport.aspx)
is a report prepared by Alma Swan and Sheridan Brown this summer for
JISC in the UK.

 

Ours is a profession that is not highly visible. This report will be
welcomed by any data librarians or data archivists who have had trouble
explaining what they do at parties, and especially those who have had
trouble getting a pay rise or a promotion based on the value added work
they do for researchers vis a vis working with data.

 

It was the NSF/NSB who first drew attention to the plight of "data
scientists" and the poorly developed career paths of researchers who
specialise in working with data within research groups in their
*Long-Lived Digital Data Collections* report in 2005. This study also
examined the situation of specialists working in domain-specific data
centres or data archives.

 

Her treatment of data librarians poses the potential for academic
libraries to get further involved with research data curation.

 

The current report draws on that as well as Liz Lyon's UK
JISC-commissioned report in 2007 on *Dealing with data: roles,
responsibilities and relationships*.

 

Luis Martinez Uribe has written a [summary of the report on the
DataShare
blog](http://jisc-datashare.blogspot.com/2008/09/new-report-skills-role-and-career.html)
