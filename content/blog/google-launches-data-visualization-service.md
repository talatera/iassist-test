Several weeks ago, Google contacted me at BLS to let us know they were
using some of our data in a launch of a new service in data
visualization.  Their plan is to make as much data available as possible
with as rich a tool set as they can provide.  To see an example, enter
the phrase "US Unemployment Rate" in the Google search box.  The top
link sends you to a page that allows you to superimpose historical
graphs of unemployment rates down to any county in the US.  There is a
link at the bottom of the page for "Information for Publishers" for
people interested in letting Google know about their own data.

Google's inquiry took us by surprise, as we have no working
relationship with them.  Our main concern was whether their launch would
impose an undue burden on our web servers, but we decided it would not. 
Every time we release a new estimate for the Unemployment Rate or the
Consumer Price Index we experience a sharp spike in web activity on our
site.  So we were prepared.  The actual launch did not contain any
surprises.

I spoke with some people at Google about their plans.  The seem to have
a good appreciation of statistical data and metadata.  They even know
about the SDMX standard for describing time series data.  It tums out,
the program manager for this work at Google is Ola Rosling, the son of
Hans Rosling, who is the person behind the Gap Minder project for data
visualization.

The world seems to be getting smaller every day.
