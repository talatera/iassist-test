![Swivel Official

those not familiar with the Web 2.0 numeric data utility Swivel - their
mission "is to liberate the world's data and make it useful so new
insights can be discovered and shared". However, it looks like Swivel
are going official! Some NGOs are directly uploading their data into
Swivel while in other cases Swivel are gathering data directly from
'official' Web sites such as OECD, ILO, UNESCO, WHO - see
<http://www.swivel.com/official>. Other than exposing their data (and
ultimately their commercial products) to a wider audience are there
other motives (other than altruism) or implications that can be drawn
from this news?
