The OECD has created an [iPhone app for the OECD
Factbook](http://appshopper.com/books/oecd-factbook-2009). 

From the site "The OECD Factbook App presents 100 economic indicators
in a format specially designed for your iPhone. Now, wherever you are,
you have easy access to a comprehensive statistical picture of the
world's major economies from the most reliable source: OECD.

The OECD Factbook is organised around 12 themes such as population and
migration, macroeconomic trends, and globalization. Each indicator
includes a table showing the latest available data for the 30 OECD
countries. When available, it also shows data from countries with which
the OECD has close co-operation such as Brazil, Russian Federation,
India, Indonesia, China and South Africa."

Additional features are the price: free and the French-language version.
 I'll be curious to see how this application is used - the best thing
about users is that they almost always surprise you with the way they
use the tools available to them.
