For those of you attending the [RDAP Summit](http://www.asis.org/rdap/)
next week in Atlanta, GA, USA, be sure to keep an eye out for IASSIST.
We are a sponsoring organization---check out the advance [thank you blog
post](http://www.asis.org/rdap/thank-you-iassist-2016/) from RDAP.

Our VP, Jen Green, will be on the scene with promoting IASSIST at the
[poster session](http://www.asis.org/rdap/program-2016/#poster). Be sure
to stop by to say "hi" and pick up your very own IASSIST logo button.Â 

Looking forward to hearing the report back from RDAP!
