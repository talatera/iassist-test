So I had the best intentions to blog the conference but alas I was
distracted - creating my SecondLife avatar to be able to participate
virtually as well as in reality was far more interesting than I want to
admit!  My teenagers were appalled when they found out I was on Facebook
- what will they say when I tell them about SusieQue!

As a technology-oriented association hosting a technology-themed
conference, it is maybe not surprising that we should experiment a bit. 
So the wonderful tech folks here at Stanford have created a virtual
world where avatars can watch the plenaries and have virtual cookies!

The conference so far has been very interesting - what a fabulous job
the program committee did!  Of course their job was made easier by the
fantastic submissions that IASSISTERs provided!  I'll be canvassing
those at the conference (in real life!) to see if I can get more
detailed session reports to post.
