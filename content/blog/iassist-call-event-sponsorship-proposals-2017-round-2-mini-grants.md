The IASSIST Liaison and Organizational Sponsorship Task Force is seeking
proposals for sponsorships of regional or local events during calendar
year 2017. In this second round of sponsorships we will be awarding up
to four grants of $500 USD each, but requests for any amount up to
$500 USD will be considered.

The goal of these sponsorships is to support local networks of data
professionals and data-related activities across the globe in order to
help support IASSISTers activities throughout the year and increase
awareness of the value of IASSIST membership.

Events should be a gathering of data professionals from multiple
institutions and may vary in size and scope from workshops, symposia,
conferences, etc. These may be established events or new endeavors. We
are particularly looking to sponsor regional or local level events that
will attract data professionals who would benefit from IASSIST
membership, but may not always be able to travel to attend IASSIST
conferences. Preference will be given to events from geographic areas
outside of traditional IASSIST conference locations (North America and
Western Europe), and from underrepresented membership areas as such as
Latin/South America, Africa, Asia/Pacific, and Eastern Europe.

Requests for sponsorships may be monetary, and may also include a
request for mentorship assistance by matching the event planning
committee with an experienced IASSIST member with relevant expertise
(e.g., conference planning, subject/content, geographic familiarity).

Accepted events will be required to designate an active [IASSIST
member](http://iassistdata.org/about/membership.html) as the liaison.
Generally, this would be an IASSIST member who will be attending the
event and although not required, may be on the planning committee or
otherwise contributing to the event. The liaison will be responsible for
assistance with coordinating logistics related to the sponsorship,
ensuring that the sponsorship is recognized at the event, and
contributing a post to the IASSIST iBlog about the event.

Proposals should include:

-   Name of the event and event details (date, location, any other
    pertinent information)
-   Organizing or hosting institution
-   Description of event and how it relates to [IASSIST goals and
    communities](http://iassistdata.org/about/index.html)
-   Specific request for sponsorship: amount of money and/or mentorship
    assistance
-   Description of how the sponsorship will be used
-   Name and contact information of person submitting proposal and
    designated event liaison to IASSIST (if different)

Proposals are due on **Friday, June 30 2017** via the [Application
Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCLhrrypR3USOLALM1ManLgqN3uGpRxdvfASCNxnpaE28qFw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
Notification of sponsorship awards will be by July 21 2017. The number
and monetary extent of awarded sponsorships will depend on the number
and quality of applications received within a total budgeted limit.
Individual sponsorship requests may range from $0 USD (request for
mentorship only) to $500 USD.

Please direct questions to Jen Doty, IASSIST Membership Chair
(<jennifer.doty@emory.edu>).
