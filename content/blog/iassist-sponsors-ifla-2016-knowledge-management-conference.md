IASSIST proudly sponsored a full-day conference about knowledge
management (KM) on August 12, 2016 in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA at the
University of Cincinnati. The theme of the conference was [Sharing
Practices and Actions for Making Best Use of Organizational Knowledge in
Libraries](https://sites.google.com/site/ifla2016km/).The conference
took place as part of the International Federation of Library
Associations' (IFLA) annual conference held this year in Columbus,
Ohio, USA.

The KM conference featured two keynote speakers: Valerie Forrestal,
author of the 2015 book *[Knowledge Management in
Libraries](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442253025/Knowledge-Management-for-Libraries)*,
and Jay Liebowitz, whose most recent book *[Successes and Failures of
Knowledge
Management](http://store.elsevier.com/Successes-and-Failures-of-Knowledge-Management/Jay-Liebowitz/isbn-9780128051870/)*
was published just this year.

In addition to the keynotes, we had six scholarly presentations from
information professionals on a variety of KM topics. [Five of the
accepted papers are available
full-text](https://sites.google.com/site/ifla2016km/abstracts-full-papers).
Outside of the United States, we had speakers and audience members visit
us from Canada, China, and Iran.

The entire [IFLA Knowledge Management Section](http://www.ifla.org/km)
thanks IASSIST for their sponsorship of the conference. In the future,
we hope that our section can work collaboratively with IASSIST in the
shared interest of information, knowledge, and data topics worldwide.

I hope to see many of you at IASSIST 2017 in Lawrence, Kansas!
