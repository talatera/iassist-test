The Edinburgh University Data Library celebrated 25 years of support for
staff and students in their discovery, access, use and management of
research datasets. On 5 December 2008, following on from the Digital
Curation Centre international conference held in Edinburgh that week,
friends and colleagues from near and far gathered in the afternoon at
the EDINA offices to celebrate the milestone with short speeches and
cutting the cake, along with food, drink and toasts. Earlier in the day,
about 45 professionals and academics gathered to consider the
significant changes that the Data Library has been part of and might
look forward to in the future. A number of IASSIST members took part.
