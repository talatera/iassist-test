[DMP Assistant](https://portagenetwork.ca/) is a bilingual tool for
preparing data management plans (DMPs). The tool follows best practices
in data stewardship and walks researchers step-by-step through key
questions about data management.

DMP Assistant was adapted from the (UK) Digital Curation Centre's
DMPOnline tool and is hosted at the University of Alberta. The French
user interface was produced with support from the Université de Montréal
Library. It is freely available to all researchers in Canada and
provides specialized guidance to help researchers utilize the tool to
develop their plan. It also offers the option of fulfilling DMP
requirements of specific funders (listed below) or using templates from
other organizations.
