Last month, [OpenAIRE](http://www.openaire.eu) (Open Access
Infrastructure for Research in Europe) and
[re3data.org](http://re3data.org) signed a Memorandum of Agreement to
"work jointly to facilitate research data registration, discovery,
access and re-use" in support of open science.  OpenAIRE is an
infrastructure for open access that works to track and measure research
output (originally designed to monitor EU funding activities). 
re3data.org is an online listing of research data repositories.

re3data.org and OpenAIRE will exchange metadata in order for OpenAIRE to
"integrate data repositories indexed in the re3data.org registry and in
turn return information about usage statistics for datasets and inferred
links between data and publications."

For more information, see the [OpenAIRE press release on the
MoU](http://www.openaire.eu/component/content/article/9-news-events/481-re3data-and-openaire-sign-memorandum-of-understanding?lang=en).

In addition, [re3data.org](http://re3data.org) is now mentioned in
[Nature's Scientific data's deposition
policy](http://www.nature.com/scientificdata/for-authors/data-deposition-policies/),
which encourages the registration of repositories with the service, as
well as a collaboration with [BioSharing](http://www.biosharing.org/).

In addition, [re3data.org](http://re3data.org) has made other recent
enhancements, including:

Now users can [browse](http://www.re3data.org/browse/) re3data.org
repositories by:

1.  subject
2.  content type
3.  country

Furthermore, a re-designed the repository record now groups information
into the categories of: general, institutions, terms, and standards. 
They have added many more repositories in the past few months, so check
it out!
