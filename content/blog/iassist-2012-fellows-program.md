The IASSIST Fellows Program is now accepting applications for financial
support to attend the IASSIST 2012 conference in Washington
[[http://www.iassist2012.org/]](http://www.iassist2012.org/%5d), from
data professionals from countries with emerging economies who are
developing and managing data infrastructures at their home institutions.

Please be aware that funding is *not* intended to cover the *entire
cost* of attending the conference. The applicant's home institution
*must* provide some level of financial support to supplement the IASSIST
**Fellow** award. Strong preference will be given to first time
participants, and applicants from Latin-American countries. Only fully
completed applications will be accepted. Applicants submitting a paper
for the conference will be given priority consideration for funding.

 [You may apply for funding via this
form.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dF95bVJRN1JtMDYtQ2ZmekRCTTJ3aEE6MA#gid=0 "IASSIST Fellows Program")

**For more information, to apply for funding or nominate a person for a
Fellowship**, please send an email to the ***Fellows Committee***
chair,[Luis Martínez-Uribe](mailto:lmartinez@march.es).
