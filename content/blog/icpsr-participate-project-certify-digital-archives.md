ICPSR will be taking part in the RLG-NARA Digital Repository
Certification project to identify the criteria repositories must meet
for reliably storing, migrating, and providing access to digital
collections.ICPSR has been selected to serve as a "test subject" in
the Center for Research Libraries (CRL) project to develop an audit
checklist for certification of trusted digital repositories. Funded by
the Mellon Foundation, this project builds on the work of a Task Force
consisting of members from the Research Libraries Group (RLG) and the
U.S. National Archives and Research Administration (NARA). The Task
Force is charged with developing criteria to identify digital
repositories capable of reliably storing, migrating, and providing
longterm access to digital collections.

RLG has released a draft of the "Audit Checklist for the Certification
of Trusted Digital Repositories," which is available at
<http://www.rlg.org/en/page.php?Page_ID=20769>. This represents the
fifth generation of the RLG-NARA group's work and provides best, current
practice and thought about the organizational and technical
infrastructure required for a digital repository to be considered
trustworthy and capable of certification.

Leveraging the RLG-NARA audit tool, the CRL project will test audit
criteria and metrics with three test subjects, including:

-   Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research
    (ICPSR)
-   Koninklijke Bibliotheek National Library of the Netherlands, which
    maintains the digital archive for Elsevier Science Direct Journals
-   Portico, an archive for electronic journals incubated within Ithaka
    Harbors, Inc.

Stanford's LOCKSS system will also participate in this effort, which
runs through October 2006.

Comments on the draft are welcomed and are due before mid-January 2006
to Robin Dale, the RLG-NARA Task Force Co-chair and project manager:
Robin.Dale@rlg.org (+1-650-691-2238).
