The World Bank has just launched a
new [Data](http://data.worldbank.org/) website that is densely packed
with newly free data and features for using the data which are
appropriate to all levels of users.

Users may browse by country, topic, indicator or listing in the data
catalog.  The World Bank says that access is now freely available for
over 2000 indicators from 1960-present. In comparison, the most recent
version of World Development Indicators, a licensed version of their
data sold to academic libraries, contained just over 900 indicators.

For users in need of single facts or simple visualizations,
the [Data](http://data.worldbank.org/) site is an attractive, easy to
use tool.  For users wishing to generate time series, pages on
the [Data](http://data.worldbank.org/) site include links to the
new[dataBank](http://databank.worldbank.org/ddp/home.do?Step=1&id=4) tool. 

[dataBank](http://databank.worldbank.org/ddp/home.do?Step=1&id=4) contains
the databases World Development Indicators & Global Development Finance,
Gender Statistics, Health Nutrition and Population Statistics, Africa
Development Indicators, Global Economic Monitor (GEM), and Millenium
Development Goals.  It uses the same software  as the WDI Online
product, so there's no additional learning curve for institutions which
have previously subscribed to WDI Online.

The [Data](http://data.worldbank.org/) site supports direct downloads of
data for most datasets and databases.
The [Data](http://data.worldbank.org/) site also provides access to APIs
for developers who wish to create customized presentations of the World
Bank's data.

Given that many users will wish to copy and paste the simple
visualizations at the [Data](http://data.worldbank.org/) site, it's a
shame that the visualizations can't be copied and pasted.

However, this is a minor quibble with an otherwise very promising
approach to data.  The World Bank has clearly thought about how to meet
the needs of different user groups and the results show it.  In
launching this site, the World Bank has also made a strong statement in
support of open data - even to the extent of eliminating the revenue
stream from WDI Online subscriptions.  This is a rare move in the
information world and worthy of praise.
