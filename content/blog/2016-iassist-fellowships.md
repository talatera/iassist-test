The IASSIST Fellows Committee are pleased to announce that we will be
awarding an IASSIST Fellowship award for the 2016 conference to the
following recipients:

***Marijana Glavica - Systems Librarian, University of Zagreb, Faculty
of Humanities and Social Sciences, Croatia***

'As a systems librarian I work with bibliographic data and manage
library automation systems. I am also involved in designing library
policies and procedures. As a subject specialist I provide information
services to psychology professors and students, and I teach a course
about information resources in psychology. In the last few years I
started to work towards establishment of data archive and services for
the social sciences in Croatia, an effort supported by SERSCIDA project
in the past and currently by two ongoing projects - SEEDS and
CESSDA-SaW.'

***Dr Bhojaraju Gunjal - Head of Central Library, National Institute of
Technology Rourkela, India***

'I am serving as Head, Central Library (Deputy Librarian) of our
institute library since August, 2014. In this capacity, I am responsible
for management of the Biju Patnaik Central Library of this institute
which employs 33 people including library staff, trainees, support staff
and has an annual budget of over Rs. 6 Crores.

Our library manages institutional repositories using the DSpace and
e-Prints tools with a number of new initiatives  under progress such as
integrating ORCID with all our repositories, research data management,
etc.  In this regard, programs like IASSIST will definitely help in
managing our data repositories in much more effective way.

The library also provides special services by implementing
state-of-the-art technologies in various initiatives such as Research
data management, Liaison Program, Migration of library software to Open
Source tools, Integration of Bio-metric with RFID, Mobile Apps including
SMS/email alerts, QR Code, Knowledge Management aspects, Discovery
Services, etc. for our library.

I will use this acquired knowledge through the Fellows program for the
development of our library data repositories in developing, supporting
and managing data infrastructures for our users and help other fellow
colleagues in implementing the same in other libraries of India.'

***Shima Moradisomehsaraei - Lecturer, Tehran Medical University & Azad
University, Iran***

'I teach information science and Information technology related courses
to library , Medical Information system and Medical bioinformatic
students. This means I teach students on how to use softwares to
manage,correct and analysis data and how to design models and graphs.
Teaching on the "indexing and retrieving" course we work on big data
and linked data issues. I also teach on another related course "medical
information systems" which I discusses big data and how it influences
medical data of the whole society.'

***Ya-Chi Lin, Data Specialist, Survey Research Data Archive, Academia
Sinica, Taiwan***

'Our institution, Survey Research Data Archive (SRDA) is an electronic
library of the largest collection of digital data in social sciences in
Taiwan. Part of my work entails is to promote SRDA and help SRDA members
to use data to conduct secondary data analysis. I go to the campus and
launch webinars to introduce the academic survey data and government
survey data, and the enquiry service of SRDA to potential users.'

We would like to welcome our fellows into the IASSIST community and
we're sure that they'll be made to feel at home by all IASSIST members
at our forthcoming conference in Bergen, Norway.
