Great News Everyone! The Government of Canada has just debuted a new
portal to their data at the [Open Data Pilot
Project](http://www.data.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=F9B7A1E3-1 "Government of Canada Open Data Pilot Project").
The pilot has launched with 782 general datasets (e.g. not geospatial)
and over 260,000 geospatial datasets. The three agencies contributing
the largest number of datasets as of launch are Department of Finance
Canada (258), Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (226), and Statistics
Canada (120). The data gathered here is freely available to all users
and comes with an apparently very broad user license.

The FAQ summarizes [user
rights](http://www.data.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=C5DBADB8-1#ws2ADE6AC1 "Open Data User Rights Summary")
this way: "The [Licence
Agreement](http://www.data.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=46D15882-1 "Licence Agreement") allows
the licensee to use, incorporate, grant end-user licences to modify,
improve, develop and distribute the data. The licensees must, however,
identify the source of the data on their derived products."

Portal users may search or browse to find datasets. Browse categories
include department, subject and, interestingly, file format. Where
available, the portal also links to
[tools](http://www.data.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=F20FC124-1 "Tools for using open data")
created by Canadian government agencies for use with datasets included
in the portal.

A search for "employment" in the general dataset section returns 163
datasets, most of them relatively recent (mid-1990s-present), but there
is at least one dataset included with a significant range. The [Atlantic
Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP): Meteorological
Data](http://www.data.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=5175A6F0-1&xsl=datacataloguerecord&metaxsl=datacataloguerecord&formid=6BA08969-C948-476D-995C-B53958E9A015 " Meteorological Data")
covers 1943-2004.

Hopefully the the Open Data Project will be successful and continue to
expand!
