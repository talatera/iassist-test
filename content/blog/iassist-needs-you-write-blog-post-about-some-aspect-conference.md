I could say this is needed because the videos and wifi weren't working,
but in fact I'd be asking anyway.

Just think how helpful it is for members who could not be with us (and potential members) to get a snapshot of views about what happened. Serious, silly, short, verbose, objective, or ridiculously opinionated impressions of one session, the social events or overall are very welcome.

Turn your personal notes into a gift that keeps on giving.

If you have any trouble posting (as a member) simply contact iassistwebmaster@gmail.com and we'll sort you out.
