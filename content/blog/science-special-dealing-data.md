In the 11 February 2011 issue, Science joins with colleagues from
Science Signaling, Science Translational Medicine, and Science Careers
to provide a broad look at the issues surrounding the increasingly huge
influx of research data. This collection of articles highlights both the
challenges posed by the data deluge and the opportunities that can be
realized if we can better organize and access the data.
 
Science is making access to this entire collection FREE (simple
registration is required for non-subscribers).
