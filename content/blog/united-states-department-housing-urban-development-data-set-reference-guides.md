Thanks to Lynda Kellam at the
[Dataland](http://uncgdataland.blogspot.com/) Blog for highlighting
theÂ United States Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) Data
Set Reference Guides. HUD has a dense website and posts a lot of data.
These two tables help you figure out which ones are most relevant for
which areas of research. Unfortunately, neither has a usefully
descriptive name or clear pattern of inclusion. The second guide is much
shorter and includes sets like the CBO Appropriations and Fair Housing
Cases as opposed to the American Housing Survey and State of the Cities
listed on the first guide.
