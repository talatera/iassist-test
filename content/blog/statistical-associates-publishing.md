[Statistical Associates
Publishing](http://www.statisticalassociates.com/) is a website that
offers guides focused primarily on correctly executing various
statistical techniques. The guides are short and provide screenshots and
step-by-step instructions for for some of the major commercial
statistical packages. One can buy the books - each at very low prices
$5USD or less per book from Amazon - or request a free copy from the
publisher with some reasonable restrictions on use.

I should note that since I don't spend much time doing statistics
myself, I feel a bit unqualified to attest to the quality of the
materials. However, I'm a pretty good judge of user guides in general
(having created a lot of really bad ones over the years) and I was able
to glean some information from Amazon reviews and from researching the
publisher himself. Therefore, I feel pretty confident in what I say
below, but do take it with a grain of salt. 

The publisher is [G. David
Garson](http://www.statisticalassociates.com/gdavidgarson.htm). In
addition to what he shares at the Statistical Associates website, he
continues to publish pretty regularly and co-authored at least one entry
in the Springer International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science (Toma,
Roxana, and G. David Garson. "Research Designs." International
Encyclopedia of Statistical Science. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011.
1224-1227.)

The guides themselves are straightforward, understandable to the novice
and most importantly, given that they include software-specific
instructions, updated often. The use of screenshots to supplement
written instructions is always a good idea as it helps the user orient
herself and breaks up blocks of instructions. Most Amazon reviews were
positive and the overriding theme was that the works are concise and
good for users at different levels. One complaint from some reviewers
however, was while the books help users figure out specific techniques
or steps in the major commercial tools, they didn't necessarily tell
you why you should use that technique. So, good for novices, apparently
yes, but users with no exposure to statistics at all? Probably not.

An open question is whether these books would do more for a user than
simply finding a similar video on YouTube. Again, I don't feel
qualified to answer this from a content perspective, but I do think
it's nice to have alternatives to video presentations for those who
learn best from written instructions.

Libraries may purchase the collection as a package - the cost is
extremely low - but I'm not sure how urgent the need would be. Much of
the site is pitched to instructors and it seems to make more sense to
view these books as supplementary course readings when the course
involves working with particular statistical techniques. So as a
possible source of low-cost course materials, [Statistical Associates
Publishing](http://www.statisticalassociates.com/) is probably a good
source.

 

Update from the publisher:

I posed a few questions in my original post and the publisher responded
as summarized next.

Statistical Associates does aim for introductory graduate students and,
relative to YouTube, they vouch for their accuracy. Dr. Garson also made
an interesting observation that "...most researchers use a single
package and therefore never have occasion to cross-verify results with
different packages. It is very common for researchers using the default
settings on different packages to come to different results. We not only
provide worked SPSS, SAS, and Stata solutions, but we reconcile them. It
is very hard to find that information elsewhere on the net." 

Certainly, in other contexts I've seen users go with defaults across
programs and end up confused. This particular characteristic seems like
an excellent reason for keeping this reource in mind when working with
your students/users.
