The Pullman House History Project is a part of the Pullman State
Historic Site's virtual museum and web site
(http://www.pullman-museum.org/) which links together census, city
directory, and telephone directory information to describe the people
who lived in the town of Pullman, Illinois between 1881 and 1940. This
demographic data is linked through a database/XML record system to
online maps and Perl programs that allow the data to be represented in
various useful combinations. This article describes the structure of the
database and XML records, as well as the methods and code used to link
the parts together and display the data.

This is an item from the first issue of a new open access journal about
libraries, technology and the future called [*The Code4Lib
Journal.*](http://journal.code4lib.org "The Code4Lib Journal")
