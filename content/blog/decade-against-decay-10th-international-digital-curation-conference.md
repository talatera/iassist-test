The [International Digital Curation
Conference](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/international-digital-curation-conference-idcc)
(IDCC) is now ten years old. On the evidence of its most recent
conference, is in rude health and growing fast.

IDCC is the first time IASSIST decided to formally
[support](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc15/supporters) another
organisational conference. I think it was a wise investment given the
quality of plenaries, presentations, posters, and discussions.

DCC already has available a number of
[blogs](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc15/blogs) covering the substance
of sessions, including an excellent
[summary](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/blog/leading-digital-curation-lifestyle-first-day-reflections-idcc15)
by IASSIST web editor, Robin Rice.
[Presentations](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc15/programme-presentations)
and [posters](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc15/posters) are already
available, and video from plenary sessions will soon be online.

Instead I will use this opportunity to pick-up on hanging issues and
suggestions for future conferences.

One was apportionment of responsibility. Ultimately, researchers are
responsible for management of their data, but they can only do so if
supporting infrastructure is in place to help them. So, who is
responsible for providing that: funders or institutions? This theme
emerged in the context of the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council who will soon enforce
[expectations](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/about/standards/researchdata/expectations/)
identifying the institution as responsible for supporting good Research
Data Management.

Related to that was a discussion on the role of libraries in this
decade. Are they relevant? Can they change to meet new challenges?
Starting out as a researcher who became a data archivist and is now a
librarian, I wouldn't be here if libraries weren't meeting these
challenges. There's a "[hush](http://all-sorts.org/nouns/librarians)" of
IASSIST members also ready to take issue with the suggestions libraries
aren't relevant or not engaged with data, in fact they did so at our
[last
conference](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/library/2014/07/11/think-global-but-act-local-information-service-conference-briefing-2014-part-i/).

Melissa Terras, (UCL) did a fantastic job
[presenting](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/webfm_send/1880) [PDF] work in the
digital humanities that is innovative in not only preserving, but
rescuing objects -- and all done on small change research budgets. I
hope a future IDCC finds space for a social sciences person to present
on issues we face in preservation and reuse. Clifford Lynch (CNI)
touched on the problems of data reuse and human subjects, which remained
one of the few glancing references to a significant problem and one
IASSIST members are
[addressing](http://iassistdata.org/about/committees.html#interest).
Indeed, thanks must go to a former president of this association, Peter
Burhill (Edinburgh) who mentioned IASSIST and how it relates to the IDCC
audience on more than one occasion.

Finally, if you were stimulated by IDCC's talk of data, reuse, and
preservation then don't forget our own
[conference](http://iassist2015.pop.umn.edu/) in Minneapolis later this
year.
