[Relu's Data Management
Planning](http://relu.data-archive.ac.uk/data-sharing/planning) site has
data management planning guidance, template and real-case examples of
data management plans from the UK-based cross-disciplinary Rural Economy
and Land Use Programme (social, environmental and biological sciences).
Relu has its own data management and sharing policy and all funded
projects are required to prepare a data management plan when they begin.
