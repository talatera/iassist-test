I wanted to share a blog post from our local Data and GIS blog that may
be of interest to the IASSIST community.  Each of the tools varies in
it's focus and applicability for data work- but they might be helpful
for various data tasks focusing on cleaning and representing data
online.

On a slightly related note, I was very impressed with the [CAR (Computer
Assisted Reporting) Conference](http://www.ire.org/training/conference/)
and the [IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors
Group)](http://www.ire.org/).  The possibility for linkages to IASSIST
appear to be quite strong.  I would encourage other members with an
interest in data visualization/computation journalism to consider
participating in future conferences.
