A new Web site, the [Geospatial Data Preservation Resource
Center](http://geopreservation.org/%20), aims to help those responsible
for producing and managing geospatial data learn about the latest
approaches and tools available to facilitate long-term geospatial data
preservation and access. The Web site provides descriptions and links
for a variety of relevant resources, including education and training
modules, useful tools and software, information on policies and
standards for preserving geospatial data, and examples of successful
preservation and associated benefits. This first release of the Web
site, which CIESIN will be enhancing over the next year, was developed
as an element of the National Digital Information Infrastructure and
Preservation Program (NDIIPP) of the Library of Congress.
