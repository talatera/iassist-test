[The New England Collaborative Data Management Curriculum
(NECDMC)](http://library.umassmed.edu/necdmc/index)Â is an instructional
tool for teaching data management best practices to undergraduates,
graduate students, and researchers in the health sciences, sciences, and
engineering disciplines. Each of the curriculum's seven online
instructional modules aligns with the National Science Foundation's data
management plan recommendations and addresses universal data management
challenges. Included in the curriculum is a collection of actual
research cases that provides a discipline specific context to the
content of the instructional modules. These cases come from a range of
research settings such as clinical research, biomedical labs, an
engineering project, and a qualitative behavioral health study.
Additional research cases will be added to the collection on an ongoing
basis. Each of the modules can be taught as a stand-alone class or as
part of a series of classes. Instructors are welcome to customize the
content of the instructional modules to meet the learning needs of their
students and the policies and resources at their institutions.

Built upon the Frameworks of a Data Management Curriculum developed by
the Lamar Soutter Library and the George C. Gordon Library at Worcester
Polytechnic Institute, the NECDMC is designed to address present and
future researchers' data management learning needs.
