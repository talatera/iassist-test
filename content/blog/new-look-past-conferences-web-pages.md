We are pleased to present the new layout for the Past Conferences
section of the website. Follow the [presentations] links for 2009 and
2010 to see the new layout.  [Past conference
pages](/conferences/archive) from 2000 to 2008 will be converted in the
weeks to come. All presentations since 2000 have now been preserved in
pdf format to ensure future access to the files.

Thanks go out to the webteam for their hard work in making this
possible.
