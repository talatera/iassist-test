The Qualitative Social Science and Humanities Data Interest Group
(QSSHDIG) was formed in fall 2016. We decided to focus our efforts on
the conference this year. We have some continuing projects planned for
next year. **We are meeting at the conference on Tuesday, May 22 at 4pm
in the Oread Lobby.
** IASSIST 2017 Conference activities:

-    Two workshops: (1) [Dueling CAQDAS -- Using Atlas.ti and NVivo for
    Qualitative Data
    Analysis](https://www.openconf.org/IASSIST2017/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&action=summary.php&id=29),
    and (2) [Preparing qualitative data for sharing and
    re-use](https://www.openconf.org/IASSIST2017/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&action=summary.php&id=33)
-    Two presentation sessions: (1) A1: Data Support for All (Panel)
    [Maximizing on The IASSIST Way: Data Support for All (without

    and (2) F2: Building Bridges for Qualitative Social Science and

Continuing Projects:

-   We are developing a blog post series on the challenges of balancing
    teaching/providing resources for qualitative *software* against
    teaching/providing resources for qualitative methods. Mandy is
    currently leading that effort.
-   We have been working on developing a LibGuide compiling qualitative
    and humanities data resources (e.g., finding data sources, analysis
    tools, etc.). We are gathering some resources now and will talk more
    about this at our group meeting tomorrow. Lynda is leading this
    effort.
-   We also have an email list for everyone interested in Qualitative
    Social Science or Humanities Data research.
-   We would love to have any  members help out with these efforts. If
    you are interested, please email Lynda or Mandy.
