[Our Managing and Sharing Data: Training
Resources](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/training-resources)
present a suite of flexible training materials for people who are
charged with training researchers and research support staff in how to
look after research data.

The Training Resources are modularised following the UK Data Archive's
seven key areas of managing and sharing data:

-   sharing data - why and how
-   data management planning for researchers and research centres
-   documenting data
-   formatting data
-   storing data, including data security, data transfer, encryption,
    and file sharing
-   ethics and consent
-   data copyright

Each section contains:

-   introductory powerpoint(s)
-   presenter's guide - where necessary
-   exercises and introduction to exercises
-   quizzes
-   answers

The materials are presented as used in our own training coursesÂ  and are
mostly geared towards social scientists.

You can download individual modules from the relevant sections or
download the whole resource in pdf format.
