The IASSIST Special Interest Group on Data Citation (SIGDC) met in
Vancouver on Wednesday, June 1, with 15 people in attendance. The group
discussed ways in which IASSIST members could influence data citation
standards and behavior. Suggestions were made to:

-   Inventory the resources that the SIG maintains and knows about
-   Create a set of simple slides to share with faculty and students;
    these might include guidelines on citation format with examples but
    would not endorse a certain format
-   Create posters on data citation to hang in prominent places
-   Contact bibliographic software companies to make sure they include
    data as a specific resource type
-   Contact style guides -- APA, Chicago, MLA -- to ensure that they are
    providing appropriate citations for data and including DOIs
-   Create a set of Web pages on this topic on the IASSIST site
-   Contact Google Scholar with a list of issues related to data

Joachim Wackerow presented information on ways to make DOIs more
machine-actionable. He pointed out that CrossRef has a new project to
provide for HTTP negotiation. This would permit the DOI to link to rich
structured metadata like DDI in addition to a human-readable metadata
record.
