The IASSIST Quarterly [(IQ Vol. 28 issue 4)](http://www.iassistdata.org/publications/iq/iqvol28.html) is now
available on the web: The issue has articles about the following topics:

-   Wikipedia. Oliver Watteler from the data archive (Zentralarchiv) in
    Cologne in Germany -- part of GESIS -- presents us for the
    fundamentals of Wiki: The [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) is a
    Web-based encyclopedia that has quickly grown in substance and in
    use. It is a free and copyleft product to be used, read, updated and
    improved by anyone. Oliver Watteler is proposing a wikipedia for
    IASSIST members with coverage of typical IASSIST topics.
-   Chiu-Chuang (Lu) Chou is a senior special librarian at the Data and
    Program Library Service (DPLS) at University of Wisconsin Madison,
    United States. She reports from a workshop on Statistical Disclosure
    Control for Data Confidentiality and the ARGUS software with the
    function of being able to "modify unsafe data in such a way that
    safe (enough) data emerge, with minimum information loss". A main
    concern is balancing the need for data and the need for
    confidentiality.
-   At the IASSIST conference in Edinburgh 2005 there was a session on
    "New Insights in Providing Data Services: A Variety of Evidence".
    The presentation on "Data archiving at the US Central Bank" was
    given by Linda Powell, who works at the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve System. Her article demonstrates and discusses
    several challenges in connection with the diverse pool of data, user
    access from several platforms as well as the growth of data
    archiving.

The printed version will shortly be mailed out in paper form to the
IASSIST membership. Articles for the IQ are sent to the
[editor](mailto:kbr@sam.sdu.dk). But please observe that there is a
paper contest running. The IASSIST has announced a [publication award
for 2006](http://www.iassistdata.org/publications/pubaward.html). Papers
that participate for the award should be sent to [David
