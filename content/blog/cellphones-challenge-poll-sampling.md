A new report from the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
reports preliminary results that have implications for surveys that rely
on telephone interviews. ([Wireless Substitution: Early Release of
Estimates From the National Health Interview Survey, January -- June
2007](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/wireless200712.pdf),
by Stephen J. Blumberg, Ph.D., and Julian V. Luke, Division of Health
Interview Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics.)

-   more than one out of every eight American homes (13.6%) had only
    wireless telephones during the first half of 2007
-   Adults living in poverty (21.6%) were more likely than higher income
    adults to be living in households with only wireless telephones.
-   Non-Hispanic white adults (11.3%) and non-Hispanic black adults
    (14.3%) were less likely than Hispanic adults (18.0%) to be living
    in households with only wireless telephones.

> ...the inability to reach households with only wireless telephones
> (or with no telephone service) has potential implications for results
> from health surveys, political polls, and other research conducted
> using random-digit-dial telephone surveys.
