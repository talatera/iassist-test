As you may have heard during last week's wonderful [IASSIST meeting in
Tampere](http://www.fsd.uta.fi/iassist2009/), there are still spaces
available in the ICPSR Summer Program course on DDI, to be held at
Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on July 13-16. The course is
titled "Documenting Data Using DDI 3.0: Supporting Research, Collection
Management, and Access," and instructors are Wendy Thomas (Minnesota
Population Center, University of Minnesota) and Arofan Gregory (Open
Data Foundation).

The DDI 3.0 metadata structure is capturing the attention of major
archives, data producers, and funding agencies as a standard that will
aid in the collection, preservation, and dissemination of social science
data throughout its life cycle. This course will show you how DDI can be
used to support the research process, making the data you collect easier
to manage, share, and analyze.

This special off-site course will take advantage of Ithaca's unique
location in the heart of the Finger Lakes region of New York State.
Activities will include visits to the internationally-renowned Moosewood
Restaurant, hiking opportunities to see some of the best gorges and
waterfalls in the area, and a day-long post-conference visit to the
Finger Lakes Wine Festival!

Who should attend: Anyone managing numeric social science data
collections or a social science research project involving the
collection of numeric data Location: Ithaca, NY

Dates: July 13-16, 2009

Co-sponsors: Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research; Mann
Library
