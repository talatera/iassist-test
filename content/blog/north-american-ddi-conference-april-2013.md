Registration is now open for NADDI 2013
(<http://www.ipsr.ku.edu/naddi/>). The North American Data Documentation
Initiative Conference (NADDI) is an opportunity for those using DDI and
those interested in learning more about it to come together and learn
from each other. Patterned after the successful European DDI conference
(EDDI), NADDI 2013 will be a two day conference with invited and
contributed presentations. This conference should be of interest to both
researchers and data professionals in the social sciences and other
disciplines. Training sessions will follow the conference. One focus of
the first year's conference will be on the use of DDI by individual
research teams through the data lifecycle.  

Please note that thanks to the generous support of the [Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation](http://www.sloan.org/), a *limited number* of reduced rate
registrations for graduate students are available.

 

Our keynote speaker will be Dr. [Jay
Greenfield](http://www.ipsr.ku.edu/naddi/JayGreenfield.shtml) of Booz
Allen Hamilton where he is the semantic architect for a DDI Lifecycle
based metadata system that supports the National Children's Study
(NCS).

 

The conference will be held in the Kansas Union at the University of
Kansas on April 2 and 3 2013. An opening night reception will be held
April 1, and workshops will be held on April 4.

 

The call for papers is also now open through January 31, 2013.
