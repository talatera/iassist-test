Interesting report applying the Open Archival Information System (OAIS)
model and the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) to the
UK Data Archive; a very useful convergence of preservation strategies
and articulation of what the model means for data and disciplinary
focused digital repositories/archives.Email from the Digital
Preservation Department at the UK National Archives:

 

In conjunction with the UK Data Archive, The National Archives have
released a report comparing their preservation practices to the leading
internationally recognised standard for digital archives. This provides
a model for other organisations to test the compliance of their own
systems.

 

Using the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model the
two organisations were able to compare their preservation practices
within a common framework: an opportunity that was particularly timely
because, in January 2005, the UKDA was appointed as a legal place of
deposit for National Archive documents.

 

The OAIS reference model (ISO 14721) is the major international standard
addressing the structure and operations of digital archive facilities.
The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) is a schema for
encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata regarding
objects within a digital library.

 

The assessment was carried out by the UKDA, The National Archives and
the Estonian Business Archive, with a funding award from the Joint
Information Systems Committee - under its Institutional Digital
Preservation and Asset Management Programme.
