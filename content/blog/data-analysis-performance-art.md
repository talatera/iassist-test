[Data analysis as performance
art](http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/07/09/data-analysis-as-performance-art/)
is the title of a posting on Jon Udell's blog where he introduces a
really nicely done screencast comparing local and national crime data
using [ManyEyes](http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home), the
online visualization software hosted by IBM.

I found the screencast, [Crime in New Hampshire: Exploring the
data](http://s3.amazonaws.com/jon/screencast/NhCrime.html), interesting
for several reasons:

It is a good example of data availability ("I've been thinking about
this because I've been trying to investigate a perceived crime wave in
my home town. You'd think it would be straightforward to get hold of the
data but, after four months, I'm still trying. Meanwhile, however, I
found some historical data at the Bureau of Justice, and I decided to
see what I could make of that.")

It shows how an amateur data analyst proceeds and how far he gets and
what he discovers about data quality and comparability. (Udell observes
"that town-reported crime statistics rolled up to a statewide total
don't agree with state crime statistics as seen from a national
perspective.")

It demonstrates ManyEyes and it's utility very nicely.

As far as "performance art," Udell make the excellent point that:

> The charts used in my screencast could have been made in Excel or in
> any other charting package. By making them in Many Eyes, I added the
> important new dimension of social analysis.
>
> But what I realized while making them is that narrated animation is
> really the secret sauce. Analytical software, whether it's Excel or
> GapMinder or Many Eyes or something else, is necessary but not
> sufficient. The stories that people will understand, and remember, are
> the ones that have been performed well.

And so he demonstrates how screencasting can be used as an educational
tool. Finally, ManyEyes provides a quick way to share data. You can
