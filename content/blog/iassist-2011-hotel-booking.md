We encourage everyone planning to attend **IASSIST 2011 in
Vancouver **to book hotel rooms as soon as possible.  There are already
room shortages due to other conferences that same week and a general
pickup in tourism.

**The Delta Vancouver Suites** reported today that there are only two
rooms left at the special $199 rate; rooms are still available in the
Premier category at a rate of $224.00 per night per room and in the
Deluxe category rate of $239.00 per night per room.
