University of British Columbia Library release their Research Data
Management (RDM) website at <http://researchdata.library.ubc.ca/>.

The website is designed to be service-oriented. Four sections, *Learn;
Plan; Share* and *Find* guide users to the RDM advice and systems
solutions that meet their current needs. The *Learn* section includes
a [**DataGuide**](http://researchdata.library.ubc.ca/files/2014/10/RDM_DataGuide_V02.5_20141209.pdf) (CC
BY 3.0) - a quick standalone guide developed to get people started on
Research Data Management, which could be re-used and adapted. 

The website also features the library's current systems offerings for
managing research data, including the UBC instance of Dataverse
(<http://dvn.library.ubc.ca/dvn/>) and UBC Library's digital
preservation system, [cIRcle](https://circle.ubc.ca/).
