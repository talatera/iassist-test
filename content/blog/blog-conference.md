Welcome to the 2006 IASSIST Conference in Ann Arbor! For those who
can't join in the fun, we (the Pubs committee and the Admin Committee)
have decided it's a good idea for us to blog the conference! (See
San's fine example below.) Use this post to comment with your thoughts
on a session that really got you thinking. And, (IASSIST members only):
become an editor if you would like to post more frequently - contact
San.

Also - as our first plenary speaker, Dan Atkins requested, please
comment on the NSF'S CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE VISION FOR 21ST CENTURY
DISCOVERY, at <http://www.nsf.gov/od/oci/ci_v5.pdf> . He would like the
IASSIST community's input especially on chapter 3, STRATEGIC PLAN FOR
DATA, DATA ANALYSIS, AND VISUALIZATION (2006-2010). But he needs the
comments soon, the current draft (5) has been out since January. Email
your comments to atkins@umich.edu.
