I'm just in the process of updating who we follow from our
[@iassistdata](https://twitter.com/iassistdata "IASSIST twitter")
twitter account (we follow members who follow us - when I get round to
updating things, sorry).

Given the huge* number of followers we now have, (595, thank you one
and all) I thought it would be interesting to see what we looked like
according to our twitter bios.

No surprises: we define ourselves as data people or organisations, in
terms of "research", "librarian" (and library related terms),
"social" "science", "digital", "information", and
"universities". It suggests people following us are the type of people
that should be following us given the organisation's
[goals](/about/index.html "About IASSIST"), and hopefully are getting
some value from following @iassistdata.

*Obviously a subjective assessment when Justin Beiber has 44,625,042.
