The [May 21 issue of Boing
Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/21/infobunker_nuclear_h.html)
describes the InfoBunker, a "Cold War era government command bunker
converted into a data center". I realize that they're not referring to
the same kind of data center we mean, but it was kind of fun to read
about a data center that has "a self-sufficient power systems (six
days' worth of diesel fuel; 17,000 gallons of water (for drinking and
fire suppression); military-grade NBC air filtration). It's built to
withstand a 20-megaton nuclear blast at 2.5 miles, according to the
website, and I can believe it. Your data will be intact even if the rest
of the Internet has been vaporized."
