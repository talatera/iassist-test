At [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/) there is a link to a
[video](http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=hans_rosling&flashEnabled=1)
of Hans Rosling's [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/) Recorded
February, 2006 in Monterey, CA. Rosling is professor of international
health at Sweden's world-renowned Karolinska Institute, and founder of
Gapminder, a non-profit that brings vital global data to life.

The video is definitely worth watching! It is interesting technically as
a demonstration of data-visualization that is way beyond what we usually
see. But it is also interesting because of the content of the data and
how Rosling uses data visualization to "debunk a few myths about the
'developing' world." It is also worth watching to see Rosling's
brief but powerful vision of access to data: the limitations of today's
systems and the possibilities for tomorrow's systems. Enjoy!
