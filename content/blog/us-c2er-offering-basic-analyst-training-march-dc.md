| The purpose of this training is to enhance the knowledge, skills and  |
| abilities of those new to community and economic development          |
| research.  This training provides an overview of key data sources and |
| effective techniques to conduct research in support of economic       |
| development strategies.  Participants will discover that while there  |
| is lots of data, focusing on a few important elements and using a few |
| proven techniques can provide tremendous insight into the local       |

| data within a framework of answering practical, real-world questions  |
| that policymakers and practitioners encounter.  For example, when     |
| asked to perform quality of life benchmarking, track local trends, or |
| develop information in support of business recruitment, industry      |
| cluster building, economic impact assessments, incentive awards, and  |
| planning efforts.  Ways to effectively communicate the results from   |
| this research to plicy leaders and practitioners are covered. Learn   |
