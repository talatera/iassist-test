The [DataCite Metadata Schema for the Publication and Citation of
Research
Data](http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-2.1/doc/DataCite-MetadataKernel_v2.1.pdf)

consistent identification of data for citation and retrieval purposes,
along with recommended use instructions. This schema was developed by
