In their never ending quest for information, Jen, Tiffani and Paula
would like to know about people's experiences cataloging data. Do you
use MARC format? Have you tried using DDI? At what level do you tend to
catalog collections? How does it depart from cataloging traditional
library matter? Enquiring minds want to know.
