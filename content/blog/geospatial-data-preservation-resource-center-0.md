The [Geospatial Data Preservation Resource
Center](http://geopreservation.org/) gathers freely available web-based
resources about the preservation of geospatial information. A variety of
selected resources are being added, including reports, presentations,
standards, and information about tools for preparing geospatial assets
for long-term access and use. The resources are indexed to enable
searching of titles and are categorized to facilitate discovery by
choosing among topics, resource types, or both.

The Geospatial Data Preservation Resource Center is a project of the
National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program
(NDIIPP), which is working with a national network of partners on a
strategy for preserving digital information for use in the future.
Information about the NDIIPP, its partners, projects, and events can be
found on the NDIIPP web site, which is accessible
at <http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/>

Resource types currently include:

-   Applications: For Download
-   Applications: Online
-   Community blogs and forums
-   Online Journal Articles
-   Presentations
-   Real-World Examples
-   Reports
-   Standards
-   Tutorials and Learning Resources
-   Websites

There are too many categories of content to list here, but it's worth
noting that the home page highlights education resources, policy
resources and applications. 

For any institution wishing to develop a geospatial preservation
program, this site seems like an excellent place to start preparing.
