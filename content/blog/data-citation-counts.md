HeatherÂ Piwowar of Duke & the University of British Columbia describes
the results of her analysis of re-use of cited datasets in [Data
Citation Counts](http://youtu.be/oivka4JnjhA)! Spoiler Alert: citation
increases re-use. Particularly interesting: not only has re-use
increased, but re-use of multiple datasets at a time is also increasing.
Neat.
