There was a lot of
[hype](http://news.google.com/archivesearch?um=1&ned=us&hl=en&q=%22wolfram+alpha%22&cf=all&sugg=d&sa=N&lnav=d0&as_ldate=2009&as_hdate=2009)
when the new search engine [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/)
was launched earlier this year.  An article in the current issue of
*Technology Review* does a better job of explaining how it works and how
it fits in with other search engines. It notes that the numeric
information it uses is "curated" by Wolfram|Alpha employees -- by
which they mean the data are selected and acquired, not just contributed
as with sites like [Swivel](http://www.swivel.com/). It also explains
the human element of ingesting the data and assigning meaning to
values.  Worth a read:
