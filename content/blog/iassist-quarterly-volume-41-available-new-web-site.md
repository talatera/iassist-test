Welcome to the first issue of Volume 41 of the IASSIST Quarterly. It has
taken extra time for this issue to appear. The cause of this is not that
we have been extra lazy.  The paradoxical cause is that a great many
people have been extra busy. Thanks to the team of people in the
editorial group of the IASSIST Quarterly and - not least - the great
help from Sonya Betz working as Digital Initiatives Projects Librarian
at the University of Alberta Libraries in Canada, the IASSIST Quarterly
has now moved to the Open Journal System (OJS) at the University of
Alberta. We believe this shift is going to benefit all stakeholders of
the IQ. It is mostly the inner workings of the production that has
changed. As a potential author you are still very welcome to mail the
editor.

The first issue of Volume 41 (2017) at the same time becomes the last
issue of that volume. In order to get close to the real time we are
catching up by jumping three issues. Therefore, this issue is labelled
as Vol. 41 1-4 of 2017. Next issue will be 42 1 of 2018. 

The new issue of IASSIST Quarterly is placed as the 'Current' issue in
the Open Journal System on the web at:

<https://www.iassistquarterly.com>

We hope you will enjoy the new open journal system. We also encourage
you to 'Register' as an author on the website. See more about
submitting a paper for the IQ under 'For Authors' and
'Submissions'. 

The archives of the IQ issues are transferred to the new IQ website. As
the website is new there might be things concerning the IASSIST
Quarterly that might not have been updated both on iassistquarterly.com
and iassistdata.org. The website for the IASSIST organization continues,
it is only the IQ that is moving to its own website. Please report
errors and confusions, thanks.

The Vol. 40 (2017) is labeled 'The data is out there - just like the
truth!' 

The first article concerns data for published articles in journals. The
paper 'Journals in Economic Sciences: Paying Lip Service to Reproducible
Research?' is by Sven Vlaeminck and Felix Podkrajac. Sven Vlaeminck
works in research data management for ZBW -- German National Library for
Economics / Leibniz Information Centre for Economics in Hamburg,
Germany. Felix Podkrajac is an academic subject librarian at the Library
and Information System of the Carl von Ossietzky University of
Oldenburg. Some economic journals have a 'data availability policy',
and Vlaeminck and Podkrajac are presenting a study of the compliance of
actual research to such policies.

The second paper in this IQ issue is titled 'Designing the
Cyberinfrastructure for Spatial Data Curation, Visualization, and
Sharing' by the authors Yue Li, Nicole Kong, and Stanislav Pejša. All
three authors are working at Purdue University Libraries as respectively
GIS analyst, assistant professor, and data curator. They argue that
spatial data is an important component in many studies and has promoted
interdisciplinary research development. In their development project at
Purdue they have streamlined spatial data curation, visualization and
sharing by connecting the institutional research data repository with
the library's GIS server set and spatial data portal.

The last paper is also addressing data management. The paper 'Research
Data Management: A proposed framework to boost research in Higher
Educational Institutes' is a collaboration between Bhojaraju Gunjal at
Central Library of the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela,
Odisha, India, and Panorea Gaitanou of the Department of Archives,
Library Science and Museum Studies, Ionian University, Corfu, Greece.
They begin with an abstract of Research Data Management (RDM) issues
where they promise 'a detailed literature review regarding the RDM
aspects adopted in libraries globally'.

Taking good care of data is worth writing articles about and is also
worth writing books about. In this issue we present two book reviews:
'Databrarianship: The Academic Data Librarian in Theory and Practice'
by Lynda Kellam and Kristi Thompson is reviewed by Chubing Tripepi of
Columbia University, while 'The Data Librarian's Handbook' by Robin
Rice and John Southall is reviewed by Ann Glusker of The National
Network of Libraries of Medicine.

Submissions of papers for the IASSIST Quarterly are always very welcome.
We welcome input from IASSIST conferences or other conferences and
workshops, and from local presentations or papers especially written for
the IQ. When you are preparing a presentation, give a thought to turning
your one-time presentation into a lasting contribution. We permit
authors 'deep links' into the IQ as well as deposition of the paper in
your local repository. Chairing a conference session with the purpose of
aggregating and integrating papers for a special issue IQ is also much
appreciated as the information reaches many more people than the session
participants, and will be readily available on the IASSIST website at
<http://www.iassistdata.org>.  

Authors are very welcome to take a look at the instructions and layout: <https://www.iassistquarterly.com/index.php/iassist/about/submissions>.

Authors can also contact me via e-mail: kbr@sam.sdu.dk. Should you be
interested in compiling a special issue for the IQ as guest editor(s) I
will also be delighted to hear from you.
