The IASSIST & Data Curation Network (DCN) hosted a [Data Curation
Workshop](http://gis.wustl.edu/dgs/iassist-data-curation-workshop/) on
December 11 & 12, 2017 at Washington University in St. Louis, USA.
Support from IASSIST, Washington University in St. Louis, the University
of Minnesota, Cornell University, the University of Michigan, and the
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign brought together approximately
45 professionals to learn how to richly curate research data from a
number of domains.

Participants came from a wide variety of functional backgrounds,
including catalogers, archivists, subject specialists, data management
librarians, repository managers, and more. Attendees traveled to St.
Louis, MO from as far away as the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville, VA and Boise State University in Boise, Idaho.
Additionally, there was a diverse makeup of institutions represented,
including liberal art colleges, Research 1 institutions, and government
agencies. Support for this workshop provided a few micro-scholarships to
applicants who would otherwise not be able to attend.

This 1.5 day workshop focused heavily on the hands-on treatments
required to richly curate research data. Attendees learned and then
practiced a six step CURATE process of checking, understanding,
requesting, augmenting, transforming, and evaluating datasets to be
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Curricula also
included the value of data curation and an introduction to IASSIST and
the Data Curation Network (DCN). Each attendee left the workshop with
experience in curating real-world data, an elevator speech for talking
about curation needs, and a plan for moving curation services forward or
enhancing existing services locally. The workshop agenda and links to
the slides are available through the [workshop
webpage](http://gis.wustl.edu/dgs/iassist-data-curation-workshop/).

Feedback from workshop attendees indicated overwhelming satisfaction
with content.  While we focused heavily on the manual treatments
required to richly curate data, many attendees wanted more exposure and
experience with software and tools they could use to curate data. The
hands-on portion of the workshop was extremely successful given the use
of real-world datasets from each of our institutions. Using actual
submissions highlighted the complexities of curating data for which an
institution may not immediately have the expertise.

The instructors for this workshop came from organizations are all
members of the [Data Curation
Network](https://sites.google.com/site/datacurationnetwork/). The DCN
project was launched with funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in
2016 and seeks to develop a shared staffing  model across nine
institutions and organizations for data curation. By sharing our data
curation expertise across a 'network of expertise' we aim to enable our
academic libraries to collectively, and more effectively, curate a wider
variety of data types (e.g., discipline, file format, etc.) that expands
beyond what any single institution might offer alone. Training and
community-building, through workshops such as this, is a natural
component of the DCN vision.

Additional data curation workshops are being planned for the near
future. For those interested in future workshops, we encourage you to
watch the Data Curation Network website for updates. We are grateful to
IASSIST for its support, without which this workshop would not have been
possible.
