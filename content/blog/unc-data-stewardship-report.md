In the spring of 2011, the UNC-Chapel Provost formed the Task Force on
the Stewardship of Digital Research Data and charged its members with
exploring the implications of data management for the University and
making recommendations for University policy.  The Task Force
investigated the data management landscape through research in the
literature, conversations with faculty and staff, and an in-depth
faculty survey designed and administered by the Odum Institute.  The
resulting report was submitted to administrators in mid-February 2012
with recommendations for university policies and procedures.  While the
recommendations specific to UNC have been **redacted**, **[the rest of
the
report](http://sils.unc.edu/files/blog/UNC_Research_Data_Stewardship_Report.pdf "UNC Data Stewardship Report")**
is now publicly available.  Although the main body of the report
reiterates material with which many in IASSIST will already be familiar,
the appendices may be of interest.  Appendix 5 provides the interview
questions for the group's initial case studies of how faculty manage
their research data, some of which are profiled in the text of the
report.  Appendix 6 provides the instrument for the faculty survey; and
Appendix 7 presents the summarized results of the survey, with a total
of 2,765 respondents.
