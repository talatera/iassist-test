Those members who follow IASST-L may recall that about a month ago I
launched an informal poll to find out whether or not your data
management plan services include reading and reviewing draft plans. I
had a total of 22 respondents with the following results:

Does your data management plan service include reading and reviewing
draft plans?

-   18% (4) - Yes, as a matter of  policy.
-   36% (8) - Not a policy, but I have reviewed them in the past.
-   36% (8) - Not a policy, but I'd seriously consider doing it.
-   9% (2) - Not a policy but I most likely wouldn't do it.
-   0% (0) - No, as a matter of policy.

Several repondents posted the following  comments. (All commenters
identified themselves by name in the poll, but I'll keep their
identities anonymous here, just in case.)

-   I coordinate development of the DCC's DMP Online data management
    planning tool. One of the functions we are adding for v3.0 (which is
    set to launch this Spring) is a facility to share read/write
    permissions with other users. We'll be very interested in seeing
    how popular this proves, as it will enable more collaborative
    development of DMPs by the researchers AND the research support
    staff, data librarians, IT people, etc who are also stakeholders in
    the data management endeavour.
-   We are on record as making the offer to help formulate and/or review
    DM plans. No written policy as yet, but it's something we're
    targetting as a service.
-   I've always offered this service in my dept. The LSE is currently
    looking at formalising a data management policy. One of the main
    aims of this is supporting researchers who need to make data
    available for reuse as part of their funding conditions. As part of
    this it is likely that some support for DMPs would be offered, but
    whether this would be generic, on-line tools, or one-to-one support
    has not been decided yet.
-   We offer this as an optional service had about 70 such reviews in
    our first year. We do have a caveat about the service on our
    website - see "limitations to services" on
    https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/rdmsgweb/About.
-   The review is optional, not mandatory, and offered as an advertised
    service.
-   I have read through a few plans when people have asked me to but I
    don't edit them and have commented when asked directly but have
    concerns about doing that. I usually state what I can and cannot
    give advice on and refer to appropriate office on campus when
    necessary (e.g., technology transfer for IP issues). Fortunately,
    most of the comments have had to do with where to put their data at
    the end (which I guess is more of a question on where to archive
    things rather than reviewing the plans). Typically I refer people
    back to sources and examples to help support writing their plans. I
    just find that when researchers ask me to look at their plans, most
    of the time they are really asking me questions about specific
    details with data management and not so much with editing the plan.
    If they did want me to edit it I would say no.

Many thanks to all of you who took the time to respond. I'm sure many
will find this information useful.
