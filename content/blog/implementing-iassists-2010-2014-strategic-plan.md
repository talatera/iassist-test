*"Data are larger than the social sciences" and data concerns have
grown beyond the traditional communities comprising IASSIST."
--respondent to strategic plan survey (2009)*

As preparations intensify for IASSIST 2011, I encourage IASSIST members
to review the [2010-2014 Strategic
Plan](http://www.iassistdata.org/documents/strategic_plan_2010-14.pdf)
with its focus on Advocacy, Community, and Professional Development.

As IASSIST moves into the second year of the plan, the organization
finds itself in an environment where data concerns have expanded to the
point that many organizations have placed data curation, data sharing,
and developing data literacy at the forefront of their agenda.  As
IASSIST adapts to these changes, its members must make choices about how
to focus our efforts in the upcoming year and how IASSIST should grow to
embrace a range of new opportunities surrounding data.

How can you participate in shaping IASSISTs future?  On a very practical
level, IASSIST has created a series of [new action and interest
groups](http://www.iassistdata.org/about/committees.html) designed to
engage the membership in many areas of the strategic plan.  I would
strongly encourage anyone with an interest in these groups to contact
the chairs to determine how to become involved.  

Action groups and interest groups are not the only mechanisms for
participating in the future of IASSIST though.  Do you have an idea for
the organization that doesn't fit the current structure?  [Suggest a
roundtable](http://www.rdl.sfu.ca/IASSIST/index.php/program) for the
conference.  [Form a new interest
group](http://www.iassistdata.org/about/all-about-interest-groups). 
Want to reach the IASSIST community outside of the conference?  Both the
[iBlog](http://www.iassistdata.org/blog) and the IASSIST list allow you
to reach the IASSIST community instantly.

IASSIST has a long history of embracing member ideas and promoting these
ideas to the larger data community.  DDI, the IASSIST Fellows program,
and the new ["Latin Engagement" action
group](http://latinengagementiassist.wiki.zoho.com/HomePage.html) all
grew out of the interests of IASSIST members.  Your ideas for IASSIST
can have a direct impact on both IASSIST and the larger data community.

The "data deluge" surrounding IASSIST has the potential to make this
period one of the most productive periods of IASSIST's history.  Get
involved and help us shape the future of IASSIST!
