**Editor's notes**

**Special issue: A pioneer data librarian**

Welcome to the special volume of the IASSIST Quarterly[(IQ (37):1-4,
2013)](http://www.iassistdata.org/iq/issue/37/1 " Spring)"). This
special issue started as exchange of ideas between Libbie Stephenson and
Margaret Adams to collect papers relating to the work of Sue A. Dodd.
Margaret Adams (Peggy) acted as the guest editor and the background and
content of this volume is described in her preface to this volume on the
following page. As editor I want to especially thank Peggy and Libbie
for pursuing and finalizing their excellent idea. I also want to thank
all the authors that contributed to produce this volume. As one of the
authors I can witness that Peggy did a great job.

Articles for the IASSIST Quarterly are always very welcome. They can be
papers from IASSIST conferences or other conferences and workshops, from
local presentations or papers especially written for the IQ. When you
are preparing a presentation, give a thought to turning your one-time
presentation into a lasting contribution to continuing development. As
an author you are permitted "deep links" where you link directly to your
paper published in the IQ. Chairing a conference session with the
purpose of aggregating and integrating papers for a special issue IQ is
also much appreciated as the information reaches many more people than
the session participants, and will be readily available on the IASSIST
website at <http://www.iassistdata.org>.

Authors are very welcome to take a look at the instructions and layout:

Authors can also contact me via e-mail: <kbr@sam.sdu.dk>. Should you be
interested in compiling a special issue for the IQ as guest editor(s) I
will also be delighted to hear from you.
