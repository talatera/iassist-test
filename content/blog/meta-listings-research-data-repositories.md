Several organizations have begun compiling lists of repositories of
research data.  These can be useful for researchers both to consider
where to deposit their data, as well as for discovery for secondary data
use.

[DataBib](http://databib.org)

Tool to identify repositories of research data.  Users can search
(including field-level searching) or browse by subject or title.  Each
entry provides a description, standardized subjects, access, start date,
and country, among other qualities.  Anyone is able to suggest or edit
repository listings, which then are reviewed and committed by an
editorial board.  This is the same list that is [re-displayed on the
DataCite web site](http://datacite.org/repolist).  Hosted by the Purdue
University Libraries.

[re3data.org](http://www.re3data.org)

Project whose goal it is to create a global registry of research data
repositories.  Database can be searched or browsed (by subject, content
type, or country).  Each entry provides a description and is tagged with
standardized subjects, content types, and countries, as well as
information on institutions, terms/policies, and standards.  Managed by
the re3data.org Project Consortium with initial funding from the [German
Research Foundation DFG](http://www.dfg.de/).

[Data repositories](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Data_repositories)

Simple listing of repositories and databases for data.  Single page
lists repositories by subject category and provides a brief description
and links.   Users can add or annotate entries.  Part of the [Open
Access Directory](http://oad.simmons.edu/), hosted by the Graduate
School of Library and Information Science at Simmons College.
