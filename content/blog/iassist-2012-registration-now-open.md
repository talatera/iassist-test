We are pleased to announce that registration is now open for the IASSIST
2012 Conference!

IASSIST 2012 conference site: <http://www.iassist2012.org/index.html>

Conference Theme: Data Science for a Connected World: Unlocking and
Harnessing the Power of Information

Dates: June 4th -- 8th, Washington D.C. USA.

Register before May 1st to take advantage of special conference and
workshops rates. Fees and other details are available at:
<http://www.iassist2012.org/indexfolder/Register/index.php>

The theme "Data Science for a Connected World: Unlocking and Harnessing
the Power of Information" reflects the growing desire of research
communities, government agencies and other organizations to build
connections and benefit from the better use of data through practicing
good management, dissemination and preservation techniques.

Information about the papers, panels, and other events can be found at:
<http://www.iassist2012.org/indexfolder/program>

The theme for IASSIST 2012 is also reflective of this year's host city
and nation's capital: Washington, DC. The seat of many US government
agencies, as well as major international institutions like the World
Bank and IMF, Washington is an ideal backdrop for discussing the
importance of data sharing and management or international best
practices. The city is also known for its vibrant nightlife, emerging
cultural scene, historical sites, and free museums (check out post-
conference tours options!).

We look forward to welcoming you to Washington DC for the IASSIST 2012
Conference.
