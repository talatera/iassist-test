In the [March 27, 2010 issue of Science
News](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/57091/title/Odds_Are,_Its_Wrong),
this article talks about how "widespread misuse of statistical methods
makes science more like a crapshoot". The problem appears to be based
in the misunderstanding and misuse of the concept of statistical
significance. The comments at the end of the article make interesting
reading, as do those at the end of the [Slashdot posting on the same
article](http://science.slashdot.org/story/10/03/17/2239252/Science-and-the-Shortcomings-of-Statistics?from=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Slashdot%2Fslashdot+%28Slashdot%29).
