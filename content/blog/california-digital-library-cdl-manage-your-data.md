[CDL: Manage Your
Data](http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/datamanagement/index.html)
provides guidance on data management plans, an overview of data
requirements of USA funding agencies and general guidance on creating,
organizing, managing, and sharing data by the California Digital
Library. Data management planning information refers both to specific
National Science Foundation (NSF) plan requirements and to more generic
guidance.
