May 21, 2008 -- The Alliance for the Data Documentation Initiative
(DDI) is pleased to announce the official release of Version 3.0 of the
DDI XML specification for documenting social science data. This long
awaited version of the DDI represents a major advance by fully
incorporating XML Schemas and moving to a data life cycle approach. We
thank all the members of the DDI working groups as well as DDI users who
have volunteered their time and efforts over the past years to make this
specification a reality. The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) is a
project to create an international standard in XML for metadata
describing social science data. The DDI Alliance is a self-sustaining
membership organization whose members guide the development of the DDI
specification. For further information, visit
