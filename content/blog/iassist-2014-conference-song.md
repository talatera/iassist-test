Sung to the tune of Gordon Lightfoot'sÂ  "If You Could Read My Mind";
thanks to San, Paula, Bill, and Vince for their suggestions, and Vince,
Dan and Kate for helping to drown out my own voice :) If anyone has a
video version of this, send me the link, so I can add it here:


If you could read my data
What a tale these points would tell
At Toronto's IASSIST 40
Data folk began to dwell
At the hockey game
We began to meet
With colleagues and old friends
These meetings never end
Aligning data with infrastructure of research is what it's all about

If you were at this IASSIST
Many fantastic talks you heard
All of the sexy specialists
Seemed to tweet on what they heard
When you reached the talk 'bout the data dude
The seating was all gone
The tweeting would go on
We don't want the talks to end
Because excitement's just too hard to fake

Chuck walked away with the plenary
When the speaker didn't show
Improv -- way to go!
IASSIST's big tent will cover everyone who works with data now
We will show them how
The Steam Whistle banquet was great
Where we could get more beer with tickets
Myron's talk went slightly wrong, his script was gone but he managed to
get it back

If you could read my hashtag
You'd have seen some tweets galore
How Justin Hayes raps data
Declare variables not war
Robin's free at last, 'cause her session's done
And Bit Rot Bitter's cool
The tweeting never ends
If you read the twitter feed
You soon will see the many things we do
The talent's always there
We always seem to feel this way
And we've got to say that we really get it
The only thing that seems so wrong
Is the long time before we meet again.
