IASSIST's Membership Committee's event sponsorship program recently
sponsored a one day workshop on Integrating Data Literacy into Library
and Information Science (LIS) Curriculum. The workshop aimed at bringing
academicians in the field of library and information science to discuss
how data literacy can be integrated in the LIS curriculum so as to have
trained library professionals who are able to provide data literacy
skills to their patrons.

The workshop was hosted by the East African School of Library and
Information Science (EASLIS), Makerere University. The workshop
attracted over 15 participants from different academic institutions that
included; Makerere University, Kabale University, YMCA Comprehensive
Institute and Kyambogo University.

The workshop was facilitated by Ms. Winny Nekesa Akullo, the IASSIST
Event Liaison Coordinator and IASSIST Africa Regional Secretary,
Ms.Sylivia Namujjuzi, a Lecturer at EASLIS, and Prof. Constant
Obura-Okello the Dean of East African School of Library and Information.

Prof Obura in his opening remarks, welcomed the participants and gave a
brief overview about EASLIS and its programmes. He appreciated IASSIST
for the continued support rendered to data literacy initiatives in the
Library and Information Profession in Uganda. In addition he
acknowledged that the workshop was timely considering the curriculum
review process that the university is undertaking.

The workshop focused on how EASLIS can integrate data literacy into its
curriculum. A presentation was made on making data meaningful and how to
use data in telling stories especially related to the SDGs. In addition,
the different aspects of data literacy that can be integrated in the LIS
Curriculum like research data management, data management
infrastructure, data security, data science among others. During
sessions, participants were also assigned group work focusing on how
their institutions can integrate data literacy in their LIS Curriculum.

Two groups were formed each made a presentation about the views
discussed in their groups. One group shared that the institution has a
course unit on library operations which focuses on general data,
however, it's important to find out which kind of data to address and to
which kind of users. The group proposed to have the data literacy skills
incorporated in this course unit. The second group was of the view to
have data literacy as a stand-alone course unit to enable deeper
understanding of its aspects and avoid duplication of data training. In
addition to also look at the data protection and privacy policy Act
2019. Dr. Joyce Bukirwa, the head of department of Information Science,
proposed that since the institutions don't have experts to train the
students in data literacy. Lecturers can start training the students in
data analysis and presentation skills using MS Excel.

Lecturers also need to gain training in data literacy in addition to
partnering/collaborating with institutions already offering it.

At the end of the workshop, participants were presented with
certificates by Dr.George. W.Kiyingi, the former Dean of EASLIS.

In conclusion the participants acknowledged that data literacy is very
significant for all courses in the LIS Cirriculum and Uganda and Africa
needs to embrace it in order to have data literate library
professionals. The participants were encouraged to work together and
champion the inclusion of data literacy in the LIS curriculum in their
institutions.
