Welcome to the[third issue of Volume 39 of the IASSIST
Quarterly](http://iassistdata.org/iq/issue/39/3 "3") (IQ 39:3, 2015).
This special issue is guest edited by Joachim Wackerow of GESIS --
Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Germany and Mary Vardigan
of ICPSR at the University of Michigan, USA. That sentence is a direct
plagiarism from the editor's notes of the recent double issue (IQ 38:4 &
39:1). We are very grateful for all the work Mary and Achim have carried
out and are developing further in the continuing story of the Data
Documentation Initiative (DDI), and for their efforts in presenting the
work here in the ASSIST Quarterly.

As in the recent double issue on DDI this special issue also presents
results, tools, and further initiatives. The DDI started 20 years ago
and much has been accomplished. However, creative people are still
refining and improving it, as well as developing new areas for the use
of DDI.

Mary Vardigan and Joachim Wackerow give on the next page an overview of
the content of DDI papers in this issue.

Let me then applaud the two guest editors and also the many authors who
made this possible:

-   Alerk Amin, RAND Cooperation, www.rand.org, USA
-   Ingo Barkow, Associate Professor for Data Management at the
    University for Applied Sciences Eastern Switzerland (HTW Chur),
    Switzerland
-   Stefan Kramer, American University, Washington, DC, USA
-   David Schiller, Research Data Centre (FDZ) of the German Federal
    Employment Agency (BA) at the Institute for Employment Research
    (IAB)
-   Jeremy Williams, Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research,
    USA
-   Larry Hoyle, senior scientist at the Institute for Policy & Social
    Research at the University of Kansas, USA
-   Joachim Wackerow, metadata expert at GESIS - Leibniz Institute for
    the Social Sciences, Germany
-   William Poynter, UCL Institute of Education, London, UK
-   Jennifer Spiegel, UCL Institute of Education, London, UK
-   Jay Greenfield, health informatics architect working with data
    standards, USA
-   Sam Hume, vice president of SHARE Technology and Services at CDISC,
    USA
-   Sanda Ionescu, user support for data and documentation, ICPSR, USA
-   Jeremy Iverson, co-founder and partner at Colectica, USA
-   John Kunze, systems architect at the California Digital Library, USA
-   Barry Radler, researcher at the University of Wisconsin Institute on
    Aging, USA
-   Wendy Thomas, director of the Data Access Core in the Minnesota
    Population Center (MPC) at the University of Minnesota, USA
-   Mary Vardigan, archivist at the Inter-university Consortium for
    Political and Social Research (ICPSR), USA
-   Stuart Weibel, worked in OCLC Research, USA
-   Michael Witt, associate professor of Library Science at Purdue
    University, USA.

I hope you will enjoy their work in this issue, and I am certain that
the contact authors will enjoy hearing from you
about new potential results, tools, and initiatives.

Articles for the IASSIST Quarterly are always very welcome. They can be
papers from IASSIST conferences or other
conferences and workshops, from local presentations or papers especially
written for the IQ. When you are preparing
a presentation, give a thought to turning your one-time presentation
into a lasting contribution to continuing development. As an author you
are permitted 'deep links' where you link directly to your paper
published in the IQ. Chairing a conference session with the purpose of
aggregating and integrating papers for a special issue IQ is also much
appreciated as the information reaches many more people than the session
participants, and will be readily available on the IASSIST website at
http://www.iassistdata.org.

Authors are very welcome to take a look at the instructions and layout: <https://www.iassistquarterly.com/index.php/iassist/about/submissions>. Authors can also contact
me via e-mail: kbr@sam.sdu.dk.

Should you be interested in compiling a special issue for the IQ as
guest editor(s) I will also be delighted to hear from you.

#### New Perspectives on DDI

This issue features four papers that look at leveraging the structured metadata provided by DDI in different ways. The first, "Design Considerations for DDI-Based Data Systems," aims to help decisionmakers by highlighting the approach of using relational databases for data storage in contrast to representing DDI in its native XML format. The second paper, "DDI as a Common Format for Export and Import for Statistical Packages," describes an experiment using the program Stat/Transfer to move datasets among five popular packages with DDI Lifecycle as an intermediary format. The paper "Protocol Development for Large-Scale Metadata Archiving Using DDI Lifecycle" discusses the use of a DDI profile to document CLOSER (Cohorts and Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources, www.closer.ac.uk), which brings together nine of the UK's longitudinal cohort studies by producing a metadata discovery platform (MDP). And finally, "DDI and Enhanced Data Citation" reports on efforts in extend data citation information in DDI to include a larger set of elements and a taxonomy for the role of research contributors.
