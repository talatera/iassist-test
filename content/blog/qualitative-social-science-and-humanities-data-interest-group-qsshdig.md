    Research Libraries for qualitative data support and training/edu
    materials. Out of 126 libraries we were able to review 116. Data are

    it for compiling a teaching materials page on our site and for
    possible article in the special issue. Thanks to Sara Demott, Liz
    Cooper, Alesia Montgomery, Jonathan Cain, and Mandy for doing the
    reviews and special thanks to Sara for setting up the Qualtrics
    survey.
