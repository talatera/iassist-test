Press release posted on behalf of Mark Thompson-Kolar, ICPSR.

12/12/2013:  (Ann Arbor, MI)---More than two dozen data repositories
serving the social, natural, and physical sciences today released a
white paper recommending new approaches to funding sharing and
preservation of scientific data. The document emphasizes the need for
sustainable funding of domain repositories---data archives with ties to
specific scientific communities.

"Sustaining Domain Repositories for Digital Data: A White Paper," is an
outcome of a meeting convened June 24-25, 2013, in Ann Arbor. The
meeting, organized by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and
Social Research (ICPSR) and supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,
was attended by representatives of 22 data repositories from a wide
spectrum of scientific disciplines.

Domain repositories accelerate intellectual discovery by facilitating
data reuse and reproducibility. They leverage in-depth subject knowledge
as well as expertise in data curation to make data accessible and
meaningful to specific scientific communities. However, domain
repositories face an uncertain financial future in the United States, as
funding remains unpredictable and inadequate. Unlike our European
competitors who support data archiving as necessary scientific
infrastructure, the US does not assure the long-term viability of data
archives.

"This white paper aims to start a conversation with funding agencies
about how secure and sustainable funding can be provided for domain
repositories," said ICPSR Director George Alter. "We're suggesting ways
that modifications in US funding agencies' policies can help domain
repositories to achieve their mission."

Five recommendations are offered to encourage data stewardship and
support sustainable repositories: 

-    Commit to sustaining institutions that assure the long-term
    preservation and viability of research data
-   Promote cooperation among funding agencies, universities, domain
    repositories, journals, and other stakeholders 
-    Support the human and organizational infrastructure for data
    stewardship as well as the hardware
-    Establish review criteria appropriate for data repositories
-   Incentivize Principal Investigators (PIs) to archive data

While a single funding model may not fit all disciplines, new approaches
are urgently needed, the paper says.

"What's really remarkable about this effort---the meeting and the
resulting white paper---has been the consensus across disciplines from
astronomy to archaeology to proteomics," Alter said. "More than two
dozen domain repositories from so many disciplines are saying the same
thing: Data sharing can produce more science, but data stewards must
know the needs of their scientific communities."

This white paper is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the
role of scientific domain repositories and their critical role in the
advancement of science. It can be downloaded at

and social science research data in the world. It advances research by
acquiring, curating, preserving, and distributing original research
data. [www.icpsr.umich.edu](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu)
