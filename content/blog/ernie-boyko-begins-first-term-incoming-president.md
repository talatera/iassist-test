Ernie Boyko began his first term as the incoming President of IASSIST in
Edinburgh. A little less than a year since his retirement with
Statistics Canada, Ernie Boyko took the reigns of IASSIST as their new
President.Â  Having retired at the end of June 2004, Ernie has kept
himself busy in the world of data as a VP with Nesstar Americas Inc. He
has also remained active as an external adviser with the Data Liberation
Initiative's (DLI) External Advisory Committee and as an instructor in
the DLI training programme. Ernie's experiences as a data producer with
a national statistical agency, a manager of Census operations and the
director of Statistics Canada's Library and Information Centre provide
him with a rich background in data services and first-hand knowledge of
the major issues facing our profession. Ernie's first IASSIST
conference was in Jerusalem in 1989 and since then, he has been active
in the organization. Most recently, he was finishing a term as a member
of the Administrative Committee for Canada when he was elected
President.

Ernie is a "strategic thinker" and we look forward to the plans he has
for the organization over the next two years. Good luck, Ernie. We're
right behind you.
