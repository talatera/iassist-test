I will start with a disclaimer that I am not a metadata expert nor do I
play one on TV but I have been spending a lot of time recently
contemplating metadata issues. Granted they have been issues that deal
with metadata in a time series world but it gave me an interesting frame
of reference for attending several sessions on metadata-related issues.
Here's my thoughts:

After attending three and a half session exploring metadata issues, the
one clear idea that has emerged is that there don't seem to be any
clear ideas. While we all seem to be comfortable with the idea of what
metadata are, we seem to have a more tenuous grasp on other aspects:
what to collect; how to collect it; who should do the collecting; why
are we collecting it? The why question might seem out of place:
obviously, it's the right thing to do to make the related data more
useful/meaningful/accessible. But does the purpose of the metadata
influence what we collect? Does the why affect the what, who, and how?

For example, are metadata collected for archiving purposes different
than metadata used for searching? Does is matter how those data are
represented? In one session, a speaker was curious to know if the DDI
was adequate for representing archival metadata. In another, a speaker
described a two stage archiving process where the second stage used DDI.
Does the answer depend on the metadata being represented? But what about
Dublin Core?

In a session this morning, a presenter questioned whether metadata
should be viewed as reporting about the data or supporting work with the
data. Does the perspective affect the practical who, what, how of
metadata? We have standards for the presentation of metadata but not the
content? Can we have such standards? Should we even try? How many common
characteristics of metadata can be found between metadata collected to
aid processing in the back office and metadata compiled from analyzing
qualitative data? Are there enough metadata commonalities between German
microcensus research data and the publication of official Ethiopian
statistics? Does it matter?
