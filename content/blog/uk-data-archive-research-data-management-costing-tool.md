[UK Data Archive's Research Data Management Costing Tool
(PDF)](http://data-archive.ac.uk/media/247429/costingtool.pdf) is an
activity-based data management costing tool for researchers in the
social sciences developed by the UK Data Archive. This tool can be used
when preparing research applications or data management plans to
estimate the additional costs above standard research procedures and
practices that are needed to make research data shareable beyond the
primary research team. Background information on [how the costing tool
was
developed](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/planning-for-sharing/costing)
is available.
