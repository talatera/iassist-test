After our annual conferences, members often want to continue
conversations with IASSIST colleagues on topics of professional
interest.  Your Administrative Committee has responded by creating the
Interest Group Development Action Group.  Its charge is to identify and
help form interest groups so members can continue those conversations.

An interest group is a great way to share information on a topic of
mutual interest, learn more about it, and share that knowledge with the
larger IASSIST membership. Interest groups also help you stay connected
to other members if you can't attend the annual conferences very often. 
There are currently [interest
groups](http://www.iassistdata.org/about/committees.html#interest)
devoted to data citation to support research discovery and data reuse,
and issues related to human subject protections. We know there's a range
of potential interest group topics that reflect the broad professional
interests of IASSIST members.

The [Interest Group Development Action
Group](http://www.iassistdata.org/about/all-about-interest-groups) has
developed a web page with more information about the role of interest
groups and a checklist to help members form them.  The action group is
chaired by [Libbie Stephenson](mailto:libbie@ucla.edu) (UCLA), and its
members are Pam Baxter (Cornell University), Paula Lackie (Carleton
College/Minnesota), and Robin Rice (EDINA/University of Edinburgh).  We
want to hear your ideas and the ways we can help you develop interest
groups that meet your needs!
