The *Chronicle of Higher Education* is sponsoring an online discussion
on Thursday, June 22 on the topic of preserving data.

 

[The Chronicle: Colloquy: Data
Deluge](http://chronicle.com/colloquy/2006/06/data/)

> Thanks to digital technology, scientists are generating vast amounts
> of valuable data that, months later, may be irretrievable or
> indecipherable. Librarians are being called in to archive that
> information, but financial, technical, and even cultural barriers
> stand in the way. Who should pay for archiving digital data? Should it
> be stored close by, where it can remain private, or in large, central
> repositories?

>  
>
> D. Scott Brandt, associate dean of libraries at Purdue University, is
> helping to build a repository of scientific data that will be
> idistributed,i or stored on the hard drives of faculty members, on
> departmental servers, or as part of a large-scale computing project
> run by Purdue and a handful of other institutions. He will respond to
> questions and comments about these issues on Thursday, June 22, at 2
> p.m., U.S. Eastern time. Readers are welcome to post questions and
> comments now.
