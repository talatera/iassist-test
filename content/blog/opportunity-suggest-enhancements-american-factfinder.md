[copied from a post to the IASSIST membership list by Terrence
Bennett.] I'm sure that this announcement will show up on a lot of
lists, but in case you haven't yet seen it elsewhere, here it is.

The Census Bureau is enhancing "American FactFinder," the Internet
gateway for downloading data from the Census, the American Community
Survey, and other selected Census Bureau resources.

If you would like to suggest enhancements to AFF (or just to learn about
the enhancements that are already planned), you can do so at:
<https://questionweb.com/63144/>

Further information from the Census Bureau appears below. Regards,

Terrence Bennett Business/Economics Librarian The College of New Jersey

Enhanced American FactFinder (AFF) Comments Requested

The U.S. Census Bureau is enhancing the current American FactFinder
(AFF) to add features and improve its functionality.

As users of our data, we value your input and want the enhanced AFF to
meet as many of your needs as possible so that you can easily access and
use data available at the Census Bureau. Therefore, we would like your
input about the new system.

We have identified a number of improvements which are described in the
link below. Please review them and then provide up to five additional
items you would like to see incorporated into the new system. (Note: The
survey will be available for comments beginning today, March 10 - March
31, 2008.) Given the limited resources available for enhancing the AFF,
the Census< Bureau may not be able to implement all the suggestions.

<https://questionweb.com/63144/>

In an effort to reach as many users as possible, please forward this
information to your colleagues and others who use data from the Census
Bureau.
