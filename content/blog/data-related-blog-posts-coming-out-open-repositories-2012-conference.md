[]{.image-right}I 'd been meaning to write an IASSIST blog post about
OR 2012, hosted by the University of Edinburgh's Host Organising
Committee led by Co-Chair and IASSISTer Stuart Macdonald in July,
because it had such good DATA content.

Fortunately Simon Hodson, the UK's JISC Managing Research Data
Programme Manager, has provided this introduction and has allowed me to
post it here, with further links to his analytic blog posts, and even
those contain further links to OTHER blog posts talking about OR2012 and
data!

There are also more relevant pointers from the OR 2012 home page here:
<http://or2012.ed.ac.uk/2012/08/20/another-round-of-highlights/>

I think there's enough here to easily keep people going until next
year's conference in Prince Edward Island next July. Oh, and Peter
Burnhill, Past President IASSIST, made a good plug for IASSIST in his
closing keynote, pointing it out to repository professionals as a source
of expertise and community for would-be data professionals.

Enjoy! - Robin Rice, University of Edinburgh

---Forward----

It has been widely remarked that OR 2012 saw the arrival of research
data in the repository world.  Using a wordle of #or2012 tweets in his
closing summary, Peter Burnhill noted that 'Data is the big arrival.
There is a sense in which data is now mainstream.'  (See Peter's summary
on the OR2012 You Tube Channel:
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jQRDWq-dhc&feature=plcp>).

I have written a series of blog posts reflecting on the contributions
made by *some* those working on research data repositories, and
particularly the development of research data services
