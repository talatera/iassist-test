IBM has announced [Many
Eyes](http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/app), a site for
sharing and commenting on visualizations.

> As with [swivel](http://www.swivel.com/), users can upload any data
> set, but the tools for visualizing and graphing the data are much
> richer. The visualization options include US and World maps, line
> graphs, stack graphs, bar charts, block histograms, bubble diagrams,
> scatter plots, network diagrams, pie charts, and treemaps. The site
> isn't yet live, but should be very shortly.
