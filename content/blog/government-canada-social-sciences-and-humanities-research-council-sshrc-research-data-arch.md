The SSHRC funding councilÂ "is committed to the principle that the
various forms of research data collected with public funds belong in the
public domain. Accordingly, SSHRC has adopted [SSHRC Research Data
Archiving
Policy](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/about-au_sujet/policies-politiques/statements-enonces/edata-donnees_electroniques-eng.aspx%20)
to facilitate making data that has been collected with the help of SSHRC
funds available to other researchers."
