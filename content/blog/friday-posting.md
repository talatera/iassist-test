One of the highlights of the after hours hanging out during IASSIST
conferences is getting to play some pool and make geeky data jokes you
don't have to explain to anyone.  

For you pool-playing enthusiasts, I share[this YouTube of a potential
future IASSIST conference
goer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7B1NhceHEg&category=&feature=edu_spotlight "5-yr Old Pool Prodigy")
.. (note, none of us can play anywhere near the level of this 5 yr
old.) 

Happy Weekend everyone!
