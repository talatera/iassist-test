I have been working on this (mostly) annotated collection of tools and
articles that I believe would be of help to both the data dabbler and
professional. If you are a data scientist, data analyst or data dummy,
chances are there is something in here for you. I included a list of
tools, such as programming languages and web-based utilities, [data
mining]{.zem_slink} resources, some prominent organizations in the
field, repositories where you can play with data, events you may want to
attend and important articles you should take a look at.

The second segment (BONUS!) of the list includes a number of art and
design resources the infographic designers might like including color
palette generators and image searches. There are also some invisible web
resources (if you're looking for something data-related on Google and
not finding it) and metadata resources so you can appropriately curate
your data. This is in no way a complete list so please [contact me
here](http://kitlas.com/contact-me) with any suggestions!

    thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data
    in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google
    Finance. These applications place very different demands on
    Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from
    [URLs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator "Uniform Resource Locator"){.zem_slink}
    to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from
    backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these
    varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible,
    high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this
    paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which
    gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we
    describe the design and implementation of Bigtable.

Data Mining
-----------

1.  [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) -nWeka is a collection
    of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms
    can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own
    Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing,
    classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and
    visualization. It is also well-suited for developing new machine
    learning schemes. Weka is open source software issued under the [GNU
    General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
2.  [PSPP](http://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/)- PSPP is a program for
    statistical analysis of sampled data. It is a Free replacement for
    the proprietary program SPSS, and appears very similar to it with a
    few exceptions. The most important of these exceptions are, that
    there are no "time bombs"; your copy of PSPP will not "expire" or
    deliberately stop working in the future. Neither are there any
    artificial limits on the number of cases or variables which you can
    use. There are no additional packages to purchase in order to get
    "advanced" functions; all functionality that PSPP currently supports
    is in the core package.PSPP can perform descriptive statistics,
    T-tests, linear regression and non-parametric tests. Its backend is
    designed to perform its analyses as fast as possible, regardless of
    the size of the input data. You can use PSPP with its graphical
    interface or the more traditional syntax commands.
3.  [Rapid I](http://rapid-i.com/)- Rapid-I provides software,
    solutions, and services in the fields of predictive analytics, data
    mining, and text mining. The company concentrates on automatic
    intelligent analyses on a large-scale base, i.e. for large amounts
    of structured data like database systems and unstructured data like
    texts. The open-source data mining specialist Rapid-I enables other
    companies to use leading-edge technologies for data mining and
    business intelligence. The discovery and leverage of unused business
    intelligence from existing data enables better informed decisions
    and allows for process optimization.The main product of Rapid-I, the
    data analysis solution RapidMiner is the world-leading open-source
    system for knowledge discovery and data mining. It is available as a
    stand-alone application for data analysis and as a data mining
    engine which can be integrated into own products. By now, thousands
    of applications of RapidMiner in more than 30 countries give their
    users a competitive edge. Among the users are well-known companies
    as Ford, Honda, Nokia, Miele, Philips, IBM, HP, Cisco, Merrill
    Lynch, BNP Paribas, Bank of America, mobilkom austria, Akzo Nobel,
    Aureus Pharma, PharmaDM, Cyprotex, Celera, Revere, LexisNexis, Mitre
    and many medium-sized businesses benefitting from the open-source
    business model of Rapid-I.
4.  [R Project](http://www.r-project.org/) - R is a language and
    environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a [GNU
    project](http://www.gnu.org)which is similar to the S language and
    environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T,
    now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be
    considered as a different implementation of S. There are some
    important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered
    under R. R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and
    nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series
    analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical
    techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the
    vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R
    provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.One
    of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed
    publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical
    symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over
    the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user
    retains full control.R is available as Free Software under the terms
    of the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.gnu.org)'s [GNU
    General Public License](http://www.r-project.org/COPYING) in source
    code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms
    and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and
    MacOS.

### Metadata

1.  [Description Schema: MODS (Library of Congress) and Outline of
    elements and attributes in MODS version 3.4:
    MetadataObject](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/mods-outline.html)
    This document contains a listing of elements and their related
    attributes in MODS Version 3.4 with values or value sources where
    applicable. It is an "outline" of the schema. Items highlighted in
    red indicate changes made to MODS in Version 3.4.All top-level
    elements and all attributes are optional, but you must have at least
    one element. Subelements are optional, although in some cases you
    may not have empty containers. Attributes are not in a mandated
    sequence and not repeatable (per XML rules). "Ordered" below means
    the subelements must occur in the order given. Elements are
    repeatable unless otherwise noted."Authority" attributes are
    either followed by codes for authority lists (e.g., iso639-2b) or
    "see" references that link to documents that contain codes for
    identifying authority lists.For additional information about any
    MODS elements (version 3.4 elements will be added soon), please see
    the [MODS User
    Guidelines](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-userguide.html).
2.  [wiki.dbpedia.org : About](http://dbpedia.org/About) DBpedia is a
    community effort to extract structured information from
    [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org/ "Outgoing link (in new window)")
    and to make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows
    you to ask sophisticated queries against Wikipedia, and to link
    other data sets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We hope this will make
    it easier for the amazing amount of information in Wikipedia to be
    used in new and interesting ways, and that it might inspire new
    mechanisms for navigating, linking and improving the encyclopaedia
    itself.
3.  [Semantic Web - W3C](http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) In
    addition to the classic "Web of documents" W3C is helping to build a
    technology stack to support a "Web of data," the sort of data you
    find in databases. The ultimate goal of the Web of data is to enable
    computers to do more useful work and to develop systems that can
    support trusted interactions over the network. The term "Semantic
    Web" refers to W3C's vision of the Web of linked data. Semantic Web
    technologies enable people to create data stores on the Web, build
    vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. Linked data are
    empowered by technologies such as RDF, SPARQL, OWL, and SKOS.
