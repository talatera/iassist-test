IASSIST Members,

I'm pleased to announce that IASSIST's 40th anniversary conference in
2014 has been awarded to the city where it all started - Toronto,
Canada!

Come join us to celebrate June 3-6, 2014, where local hosts from Ryerson
University, the University of Toronto, and York University are looking
forward to quoting Tourism Toronto's greeting of "Welcome to Toronto!
We've been expecting you!"

Meanwhile, our friends at GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social
Sciences are gearing up to host IASSIST 2013 in Cologne, Germany from
May 28 --31.  The theme of this year's conference is "Data Innovation:
 Increasing Accessibility, Visibility, and Sustainability."  Stay tuned
for conference acceptances notices; they will be delivered by February
5.  <http://www.iassist2013.org/iassist-2013-home>/

Finally, I'm currently accepting proposals for IASSIST 2015 and beyond.
 If your organization is interested in hosting a future IASSIST
conference, please drop me a note; you will find more information about
hosting at <http://www.iassistdata.org/conferences/hosting.html>.

Bis Köln,

Bill Block

IASSIST President
