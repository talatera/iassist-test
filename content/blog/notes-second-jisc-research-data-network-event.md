Jisc held their second Research Data Network event in Cambridge. I went
along to take notes.

Danny Kingsley gave an overview of why data sharing is important, which
was useful as introduction for those new to this, and a refresher of
first principles to the more experienced.

The day then moved into parallel sessions on aspects of the network's
activity.

The Research Data Shared Service is an initiative to help intuitions
with RDM infrastructure. Jisc research suggests the priority for
universities is addressing the digital preservation gap. Consequently,
Jisc are looking at providing data repository and long-term preservation
services as well as considering how a service could integrate with
existing CRIS systems and repositories. This will take place in a
"University of Jisc" that allows a testing environment using research
data.

Jisc are developing templates and guidance for publishers on creating a
research data policy which can then adapt to their journals. They are
working with Springer Nature who are trying to fit their 3000 journals
to into one of four types of data policy, ranging from encouraged to
mandatory sharing and availability criteria.

Cambridge's Research Data support service provided insight into
engaging researchers in research data management. Their initial
compliance message was not working, so they switched to a positive
benefits message. This is underpinned by "adequate provisions": online
information, consultancies, reviewing data management plan, and training
sessions. They also invest resources in advocacy and outreach including
a "democratic" approach involving researchers in shaping the service
and policies.

Jisc are developing a "core" metadata profile for research data. The
profile is based on focus group testing, and integration with existing
standards. The aim is to encourage better quality metadata submissions
from researchers, with "gold, silver, and bronze" thresholds.

The final session introduced Jisc's template business case for RDM
support. This is intended to allow institutions to adapt a structured
case for supporting RDM services that can be presented to university
management. The case covers the economic benefits of data sharing and
preservation, along with institutional and researcher benefits, with a
focus on numbers. My particular favourite: UK universities hold an
estimated 450 petabytes of research data. The case will be available
this autumn.
