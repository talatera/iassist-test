Back in early April, I canvassed the IASSIST list for examples of
articles, studies, or any publication that misuses data.  My original
message:

"Do you keep news stories that mis-state, misinterpret or otherwise
misuse numeric data?  I have a faculty member who would like to use such
examples to demonstrate to her students the importance of numeracy in
real life.  I have a few examples but suspect others of you may stash
this kind of thing in a "Can you believe this?!" kind of folder.  If
you would be willing to share citations with me, I would very much
appreciate it.  This could be opening a floodgate, I realize, so let's
say English-language stories that have appeared in the last year.

Thanks!"

In fact, it wasn't a floodgate and I'm hoping to collect more examples,
but below is a summary of the responses I received.

=========================================

Book:  "The Obesity Myth" by Paul Campos might be worth looking at.
The first few chapters are all about how questionable studies with
relatively small samples have been used to shape health care policy
regarding obesity, while larger studies whose methods are less
controversial are ignored.

Sources for Such Stories

1. One very nice resource for this sort of thing is the Statistical
Assessment Service at George Mason University (STATS) at:

2. (the following two are more about visualizations of data)

3. Many sessions at the annual conference of the American Association
for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) have touched on this topic over the
years.  You might take a look at past conference programs for sessions
dealing with "The Media and Public Opinion Research" (or similar
titles) to identify specific panelists who could provide numerous
examples.  The AAPOR web site is <http://aapor.org/>.

=========================================

The trouble is, these examples/sources mostly point out why they're bad
examples.  The faculty member I'm working with would like to have her
students read the items (so, preferably articles) and then identify for
themselves why each is a bad use of data.  Obviously, there could be a
wide range of "badness" and what level of student would recognize the
problem(s), but she is working with first-year undergraduates so things
for that audience are of greatest interest.  I think it would be great
to keep a bibliography of such examples.  Or is this a libelous
venture?  Am I better off culling citations for bad examples from these
sources?
