RDA Congratulates IASSIST on Successful Conference

Earlier this month, several members of the Research Data Alliance had
the pleasure of attending and participating in the 41st IASSIST
Conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  With the theme "Bridging the Data
Divide: Data in the International Context," the conference provided an
ideal venue for us to exchange perspectives with attendees on numerous
data-related challenges and trends as well as share recent
accomplishments of the RDA.

We were intrigued by the presentation of Steven Ruggles, Director of the
Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota, which
covered the U.S. Census' role in data innovation and the Minnesota
Population Center's project to connect census data. Curtiss Cobb,
manager at Facebook, was impressive during his discussion detailing
Facebook's approach in evaluating and aggregating publicly available
data to conduct in-depth analyses. In the presentation covering the
implementation of an open data policy in Minneapolis, Andrew Johnson,
city councilor, clearly demonstrated the importance of government's role
in ensuring the accessibility of data to the public.

RDA's two panel sessions titled "First Products of the RDA" were also
well received.   Several of our members introduced RDA's recently
released products, which include:

•    A terminology query tool, already adopted by DataFed and CLARIN,
which ensures researchers use common terminology when referring to
data.
•    A data type model and registry that provides machine-readable and
researcher-accessible registries of data types that support the accurate
use of data.  
•    Machine-actionable policies and templates to enable best practices
in data management and interchange between communities
•    A Prototype Metadata Standards Directory describing hundreds of
metadata standards in an editable and transparent system with full
version control.  

For more information on these and other RDA products, view RDA's
brochure titled "[Research Data Alliance
Outputs](https://rd-alliance.org/files/blog/RDA_Outputs_May2015_web.pdf)."
 
Overall, with an agenda encompassing plenaries, workshops and various
meetings, the IASSIST conference did an excellent job in covering
numerous data-related topics that impact the social sciences as well as
numerous other disciplines. We look forward to participating in future
IASSIST events and working with the organization to continue to raise
awareness on the importance of data sharing and exchange.
