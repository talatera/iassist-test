Luis Martinez, IASSIST member and Data Librarian at the London School of
Economics, has begun an entry on Wikipedia on the topic "Data
Library". Luis welcomes this community's help in fleshing it out and
providing more context. For those who have never been involved with
Wikipedia, the editors come round and add comments, and often seem to
judge the importance of an entry based on the number of people involved
with 'curating' it. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_library>

Â 

So if you've never edited a Wikipedia topic before, this is your
chance! To get to grips with the notation, you can play around in the
'sandbox' area. Or, go right in and 'edit' and try to copy the
notation from elsewhere in the wiki. You can see who made changes to
what in the History tab. There is an internal link to 'datasets' from
the entry, which may also need some work!
