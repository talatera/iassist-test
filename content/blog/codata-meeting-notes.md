The US National Committee for CODATA and its subgroup on Permanent
Access to Scientific Data met on July 13 and 14 at the National
Academies in Washington, D.C. I [Gretchen Gano] was invited to
participate as a guest. Below are links, a background on the committee,
and some meeting highlights from my perspective with proposed follow-on
IASSIST activities. I will forward a list of the proposed activities to
the conference-planning list!

**Background:**

CODATA is an interdisciplinary Scientific Committee of the International
Council for Science (ICSU), which works to improve the quality,
reliability, management and accessibility of data of importance to all
fields of science and technology. Its mandate includes all types of data
resulting from experimental measurements, observations and calculations
in every field of science and technology, including the physical
sciences, biology, geology, astronomy, engineering, environmental
science, ecology and others. Particular emphasis is given to data
management problems common to different disciplines and to data used
outside the field in which they were generated.

The U.S. National Committee (USNC) for the [Committee on Data for
Science and Technology (CODATA](http://www.codata.org/)) functions as a
bridge between the scientific and technical community in the United
States and the international CODATA on data issues addressed in the
natural sciences.

**Meeting highlights with notes about proposed IASSIST follow-up
activities:**

Notes from Archiving subgroup meeting:

1.  CODATA/ICSTI Portal on Permanent Access
    The planned portal will provide information on data archiving
    specifically targeted toward those in developing nations.
    ***PROPOSED IASSIST ACTIVITY*** -- Dr. Anderson, chair of the
    archiving subgroup, could be invited to make a presentation on
    CODATA initiatives and the CODATA/ICSTI Portal on Permanent Access.
2.  The archiving group is planning two workshops for the coming year --
    one in Southern Africa (Sept 5-7, 2005) and one in Latin America in
    the spring of 2006.

Notes from the Main Committee Meeting:

1.  The next CODATA conference will be held in Beijing, Oct 23-25, 2006.
    Organizers would like to expand the attendance by including
    ancillary workshops.
    ***PROPOSED IASSIST ACTIVITY*** -- IASSIST could organize an
    ancillary workshop for the Beijing, China, CODATA meeting in the
    fall of 2006 on archiving in the social sciences.
2.  Update on World Summit on the Information Society
    [WSIS](http://www.itu.int/wsis/)-related CODATA activities and
    USNC/CODATA support
    
    Paul Uhlir, Director, U.S. National Committee for CODATA, is
    conducting an inventory of US activities related to WSIS goals. The
    intent is to provide concrete evidence of activities that support
    WSIS goals in the United States. The inventory will become an
    on-line resource at [WSIS on-line](http://www.wsis-online.net/).
    
    ***PROPOSED IASSIST ACTIVITY*** -- An on-line form for submitting
    descriptions of activities for the inventory is being developed at
    the National Academies. I will forward a link to the survey to the
    IASSIST list when it is ready. IASSIST members are encouraged to
    report on relevant activities at their home institutions.
3.  There was a report from the Russian national CODATA committee and a
    discussion about collaborating with USNC CODATA in upcoming
    activities in Eastern Europe.
4.  The committee meeting included a forum on [NSB report on Long-Lived
    Digital Data
    Collections](http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/2005/LLDDC_report.pdf)
    [pdf].

    
    Select points from the discussion:

    

    -   There should be a cross-agency review to establish policy and
        articulate level of commitment toward data preservation at US
        agencies.
    -   Data management proposals should address data lifecycle
        concerns. Proposal evaluation should be based on lifecycle
        considerations.
    -   Data management plans should be evaluated by qualified reviewers
        and should represent a higher priority in the overall proposal
        review process.
    -   Data preservation proposals should not have to compete with
        proposals to fund new research. Funding agencies should
        encourage new research that utilizes and synthesizes existing
        data collections -- building complex models and devising new
        uses for existing data.
    -   There should be a discussion in the library community and at
        academic institutions about how to support data archiving across
        the sciences. Funding agencies should offer incentives to
        advance this discussion.
    -   Data centers should have a resident data scientist and should be
        able to secure support for original research. Funding agencies
        should help create career paths for people in digital data
        centers.
    -   NSF could consider mandating data management training for all
        researchers just as NIH requires human subjects training for
        grantees.
    -   There should be a study of how the new requirements at NIH have
        impacted data archiving. Costs models and process should be
        documented to produce an analysis of costs and benefits.
