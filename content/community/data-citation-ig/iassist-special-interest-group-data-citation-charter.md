The Special Interest Group on Data Citation (SIGDC) of the International Association of Social Science Information Services and Technology (IASSIST) was created to promote awareness of data-related research and scholarship through data citation. Citing data supports the discovery and reuse of data, leading to better science through the validation of results. It also recognizes data as an essential part of the scientific record.

The SIGDC acknowledges the variety of audiences and stakeholders for whom data citation is important, including:

- Data producers and researchers – Data citation raises the visibility of their data and may have an impact on tenure and promotion through citation-related metrics.
- Publishers/publishing platforms – Data citation makes the linkage between publications and underlying data explicit and enhances the rich web of associations linking content creators and their scholarly output.
- Data users – Data citation enables authors to cite data used in an article and allows secondary analysts to find data resources of interest and to conduct literature reviews.
- Librarians and information professionals who help data users – Data citation helps librarians support their patrons with respect to data discovery and reuse.
- Funding agencies – Data citation permits funders to measure the impact of their investments.
- Solutions and standards developers – Data citation facilitates standardization and machine-actionability.

The SIGDC will pursue its common interest in data citation in the following ways:

- Recommend data citation standards and best practices for their use
- Work with vendors and projects to ensure that data are cited and linked to publications
- Advance the use of persistent identifiers
- Support data citation-related initiatives and programs
- Collaborate and liaison with similar groups in other organizations
- Promote awareness and develop pedagogy for data literacy and the data lifecycle as it relates to citation

The group will share information about its work through the IASSIST list, the IQ, the IASSIST blog, and sessions at the IASSIST conference as well as other venues and meetings. The chair (or co-chairs) of the SIG will be elected by majority vote of SIG members every year at the time of the annual IASSIST conference.
