I am going to keep this years report short and focus on a few
significant initiatives that are going to set a direction in Canada over
the next few years.

**DDI** - There are 4 significant projects around DDI that are coming
together. In November at a DINO meeting at Ryerson University we had the
opportunity to hear about all these initiatives and see how they
interrelate and can build on each other. In a sense, they build on what
was proposed by the CANDDI group, that first met at IASSIST in Madison.
This is an opportunity to put some meat on the bones of those ideas.

Statistics Canada's external DDI project (CANDDI): Members from DLI
institutions, the RDC' and Statistics Canada have been meeting to
develop best practices around variable groups, tag sets and other
metadata questions. They are in the process of producing a discussion
document that will be shared with all other projects.

1.  Statistics Canada's external DDI project (CANDDI): members from DLI

    metadata questions. They are in the process of producing a
    discussion document that will be shared with all other projects.
2.  Statistics Canada's internal DDI Project: Special Surveys is
    experimenting with implementing DDI at the production level. Several
    other divisions have joined in this venture, including Census,
    Health NLSCY and others. This is a very significant and exciting
    development.
3.  RDC/CFI metadata project: In last yea's report we mentioned a grant
    submission to the CFI's Leading Edge fund. This application was
    successful and the group received approximately $4million dollars
    over 5 years. The project is based out of the University of
    Winnipeg, with strong leadership from colleagues at Alberta. Part of
    the project is to mark up files in the RDC as well as create tools
    for migration to DDI 3. This project is in the process of looking
    for a project manager and issuing RFP's to undertake the tasks.
4.  ODESI - in last years report we mentioned a discussion paper coming
    out of DINO, a subcommittee of OCUL -- Ontario Council of University
    Librarians. This discussion paper proposed a building on the success
    of Scholar's portal by providing mark-up and access to our data
    collections. It was designed to integrate with the best practices
    being developed by CANDDI and strengthen services across the
    province. This project is now moving forward, being jointly funded
    by member institutions as well as a $750k grant from the Ontario
    Government. It is currently in the process of looking for a project
    manager, establishing detailed requirements and job descriptions.
    The project will be lead by the Carleton University, with assistance
    from the University of Guelph.

Other Initiatives:

From Jeff Moon: the **Canadian Opinion Research Archive** (**CORA** -
<http://www.queensu.ca/cora/>) is in the process of implementing
Nesstar. This is happening in cooperation with the Social Science Data
Centre (part of Queen's University Library) which is also implementing
Nesstar.

In September and October, 2006, Chuck Humphrey participated in the
ARL-NSF consultation on Digital Data Curation and Management. Invited
participants were asked to submit position statements on the top three
issues in long-term preservation, management, and curation of scientific
data in digital form. These position papers and a series of
recommendations were published in the report: "To Stand the Test of
Time: Long-term Stewardship of Digital Data Sets in Science and
Engineering; A Report to the National Science Foundation from the ARL
Workshop on New Collaborative Relationships: The Role of Academic
Libraries in the Digital Data Universe September 26-27, 2006"

Statistics Canada has convened a committee to look at the importance of
continuing to create PUMF's. With the increase in the number of
longitudinal files, disclosure has become a significant concern. The
committee is looking at restricting geography, producing more synthetic
files and a virtual laboratory. We will wait and see where this goes.

In August 2006, Chuck Humphrey was invited to serve on the SSHRC
Standing Committee on Research Support, which is a first for the library
data services community. This Committee provides policy advice to the
SSHRC Council and administrative advice to SSHRC staff on activities in
research, strategic and dissemination programs.

In January 2007, Chuck Humphrey was asked to serve on the Strategy
Development Committee (SDC) of the Canadian Digital information Strategy
spearheaded by the Library and Archives Canada. The formation of this
Committee grew out of the National Summit on a Canadian Digitial
Information Strategy held on December 4-5, 2006. The SDC has been tasked
to advance, guide and validate the development of a strategy and
consists of representation across Canada from the cultural, scientific
and government.

**RDC'**s -- The RDC National Coordinating Committee met in London,
Ontario in April 2007. The proposal mentioned above was one of the
discussion points. There was also an interesting presentation on open
source initiatives.

That's all for this year. :-)
