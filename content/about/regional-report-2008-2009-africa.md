IASSIST Report of the African Regional Secretary

By
Kitzito Kasozi
Director Information Technology
Uganda Bureau of Statistics
2009

This report is centered on the Africa Association of Statistical Data
Archivists (AASDA), a Community of Practice (CoP) that was formed to
enhance the potentials of preserving and mining of micro data in Africa.
AASDA is an affiliate of IASSIST. The activities that are reported on
are part of the planned activities.

A [website for the association](http://www.aasda.net) was developed
thanks to IHSN support and launched in 2008. A call for membership was
made to relevant institutions. Since then the association has registered
more members raising from the founder 26 to 60 registered members. These
include 20 persons from the academia and 40 professionals in the area of
data management. More membership will be realized as the drive for open
data access continues. A few members have taken advantage of different
opportunities to advocate for the association and its objectives.

**National Data Archives (NADA)**

A number of member countries have advanced in developing their NADA. The
progress is varied with Ethiopia topping at 65 surveys fully documented
and uploaded on their NADA. The rest include:

-   Nigeria (20)
-   Niger (15)
-   Uganda (12)
-   Gambia (10)
-   Liberia (9)
-   Ghana (6)
-   University of Cape Town (10)

IHSN has continued to support this activity as well as other areas aimed
at improving data quality and accessibility. Links to the NADAs can be
found on the AASDA website or individual country websites. Data
documentation and archiving is still a big challenge in Africa. The
increasing demand for microdata and local capacities being built might
help in overcoming the challenges. AASDA remains committed to supporting
research through increased access and open sharing of valuable
microdata.
