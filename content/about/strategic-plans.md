In 2010, a two year long effort to produce an updated five-year Strategic Plan for IASSIST was completed by the organization's Strategic Plan Action Group. At the 2010 Annual Conference of IASSIST, the Administrative Committee approved the strategic plan and set its implementation into motion.

The focus of the plan is on the following strategic directions:

1.  **Advocacy**: For policies that increase access to data and promote
    responsible data curation.
2.  **Community**: Cultivate a community that supports full data
    life-cycle; creation, use and preservation of data.
3.  **Professional Development**: Provide resources to foster the
    development of data professionals.

Under these three strategic directions, IASSIST members are working together to advocate for responsible data management, to build a broader community surrounding research data, and encourage the professional development of data professionals.
