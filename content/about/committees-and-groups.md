#### [Health Data Interest Group](/community/hdig) (HDIG) {#health-data-interest-group}
The availability of health data about individuals, gathered from     surveys or health care systems, are an invaluable resource for     researchers who wish to examine interactions between individuals and     the healthcare they receive. In addition, there is now much more     demand for research and analysis of linked health and social data     (for example, health records linked with education or social     security records). Particular challenges face data professionals who     seek to acquire health, and linked health data. The IASSIST Health     Data Interest Group has been established to bring together data     practitioners and technicians who manage access to health, and     health-linked data for research purposes, in order to share     expertise and enable members to overcome challenges in their     day-to-day roles.
