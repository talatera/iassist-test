-   Canada (W Watkins)
    National Data Archive Committee round II report was accepted 3 days
    ago. Rest of report on web.

-   USA (P Adams)
    P Doyle was named a fellow of the American Statistical Assn last
    year. Report for 2001 now up on the web; the report for 2002 is
    pending. A great deal of data activity in the United States in last
    year. P Adams commended members of APDU for taking risk of holding
    meeting in shadow of damaged pentagon shortly after September 11th.
    The President's report on homeland security focussed on data, data
    integrity, data standards, and telecommunications infrastructure. US
    members are urged to make our experience of data known to elected
    officials because they need our expertise.

-   Europe (M Wright)
    Report will be posted on the web. 82 members in the region from 21
    countries, largely due to last year's Outreach Action Group. 15% of
    members are from eastern Europe. Lots of collaborative, pan-European
    projects.

#### 4.3 Treasury (J Dionne for W Thomas)

The association is in good financial shape, having added to reserves
last year. A budget has been accepted, and it does balance. Outreach
Action Group budget will be $2000 next year.

#### 4.4 Archives (A Green for Y Hackett)

Archives in process of being consolidated., with the work being done at
University of Toronto. Funds have been approved funds for a Master of
Information Studies student to document what is there, and a letter will
be sent to past presidents requesting their old files

#### 4.5 Action Groups

**4.5.1 Outreach Action Group (I Einowski)**

The mission of the Outreach AG is to assist archivists and data
professionals from developing countries to attend IASSIST conferences.
Have funded a total of 36 people since the AG began. Last year the AG
had a lot of money, including funding from the World Bank, UNESCO, IFDO
and IASSIST, and 20 people attended. This year, the AG was funded with
only IASSIST funds, and only one attendee was funded, from Bulgaria.
Would like the AG to begin to serve more as a liaison, looking for
funding agencies to partner with us to perhaps bring a conference to a
developing country that is wanting to set up a data archive. Contacts
are important in this process.

**4.5.2 Web site**

Report deferred.

**4.5.3 Representation and Liaison**

Mission is to document liaisons and memberships with other organizations
and institutions. Chaired by R Dekker.

#### 4.6 Interest groups (A Green)

In the past, interest groups have been formed around e.g. the Data
Documentation Initiative. Last year there was also an interest group
formed focused on issues pertinent to the U.S. A Green reviewed the
process for setting up an interest group.

A proposed new interest group for the coming year: to develop a 5-10
year strategic plan. The last 5-year plan is now 15 years old. The
interest group will be chaired by B Block. Needs to reflect the virtual
community.

#### 4.7 Membership Committee (S Giles)

Focussing on providing content for new web site. The membership database
should be totally up to date by the end of the summer. A new brochure
will be developed. The directory of members has gone to press. Will also
be conducting an analysis of membership over time to review
representation.

#### 4.8 Publications and Communications Committee (L Neidert and P Yott)

KB Rasmussen and L Niedert will be focussing on in expanding content. L
Niedert is the point person to obtain copies of power-point
presentations. Will be contacting session chairs and presentors. KB
Rasmussen thanked all the people who have been active in producing the
IASSIST Quarterly. Especial thanks to W Piovesan who worked on layout.
Special plea for the papers from the current conference.

#### 4.9 Committee on the Constitution (C Geda)

Proposed revisions to the constitution will be mailed to the membership.
Also distributed in conjunction with the fall election for a vote on the
revisions.

#### 4.10 Nominations and Elections (P Burnhill)

couple of elections. The members will be asked to submit nominations.

### 5. Conference reports

#### 5.1 Storrs, Ct. 2002

A year and 3 months ago, IASSIST lost the original proposed conference
location. The Roper Center stepped in, and success of this conference on
short notice is stunning.

The 2003 conference will be in Ottawa, Canada, at the Novotel Hotel and
University of Ottawa facilities. C Humphrey is the program chair. There
will be no conference bags. Conference dates: May 27 workshops, May
28-30 conference. The conference excursion will be a river cruise on the
Ottawa River

you will get by coming to IASSIST".

The site will also be available have the DNS www.iassist.info.
