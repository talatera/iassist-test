Report of the European Regional Secretary

by
Bridget Winstanley
The Data Archive
University of Essex, UK
May 1997

::: {style="font-size:12px;"}

**Per Nielsen**
:   The European Region and IASSIST as a whole are the poorer for the
    loss of Per Nielsen. His untimely death on December 27 1996 has
    deeply saddened us all.

<!-- -->

**Introduction** 
:   The news items recorded below show some of the activities in the
    European region which involve IASSIST members. I know that there are
    very many more, but the deadline has come and gone, so this must be
    posted! I am sure that I shall have more to add when I present my
    verbal report at Odense in May.

**The ILSES project** 
:   (Information supplied by Repke de Vries)
:   A group of Dutch, German, French and Irish institutes has been
    successful in obtaining funding from the European Commission under
    the 4th Framework for a project which will provide access to
    documentary information and empirical data related to large-scale
    surveys such as the binannual Eurobarometer surveys. ILSES is
    designed to serve both end-users and content-providers of
    socio-economic information.
:   ILSES allows end-users to extend literature searches to access to
    empirical data. This allows them to extend classic literature
    research with their own original empirical analyses of relevant
    data. ILSES of course also offers the other route: directing
    data-analysts searching for specific empirical data to be used in
    secondary analysis to literature in which results and outcomes of
    previous and similar analyses have been reported.
:   For content-providers ILSES offers tools and procedures for the
    normalization, cataloguing and controlled distribution of
    (distributed) holdings of the documentary and data resources
    mentioned above. Such content-providers are the database
    administration staffs of libraries and data archives. ILSES will
    enable them to drastically increase and improve the utilization of
    their information resources while at the same time reducing their
    support burden per information request or retrieval.
:   ILSES will be designed as an open system which can be applied to
    different kinds of library and data holdings. In this project,
    however, a pilot-application will be focused on socio-economic
    information as collected by large scale surveys, and on the
    associated literature.
:   ILSES is based on integrated relational databases of
    meta-information pertaining to both library and data-archive
    holdings, both of which are typically distributed over many
    different institutions.

**The NESSTAR Project (Networked European Social Science Tools and Resources)** 
:   The NESSTAR project is utilising recent advances in Internet
    technology to meet the increasing demand for European data. The
    project has spent 12 months as a "Preliminary Pilot Project,"
    funded by the European Union. This time was spent evaluating
    available technologies, identifying user requirements and developing
    a functional specification, a blue print for the final system. The
    original partners, The Data Archive, Norwegian Social Science Data
    Services and the Danish Data Archive have now been joined by the
    Irish Central Statistics Office, The Norwegian Institute of
    Journalism, The University of Aarhus in Denmark, Anàlisis
    Sociológicos Económicos y Politicos and JD Systems, both of Madrid.
    These partners have submitted a new proposal to the EU. If
    successful the partners will spend the next two years building a web
    based system to provide online facilities to:
    1.  locate data sources and browse metadata
    2.  browse, analyse and visualise data and documentation
    3.  deliver data and documentation (including subsets) in a variety
        of formats
    4.  encourage feedback from, and communication between users

:   NESSTAR will lower technical barriers to data allowing users with
    few computing and statistical skills to access these valuable
    sources of information. It will also facilitate cross-national
    research. Further information about the project can be found at the
    project's website, <http://dawww.essex.ac.uk/projects/nesstar>. Any
    questions or comments about the project should be directed to Simon
    Musgrave or Michelle Rogerson.

**News from Ireland** 
:   Ken Hannigan has supplied the following information:
:   Because Ireland held the Presidency of the EU last year Ireland was
    able in October to host a meeting of European experts on electronic
    records as part of the programme of cultural events under the
    Presidency. It included a half-day seminar for Irish archivists on
    the subject of electronic records and the launch of "For the
    Record", the proceedings of the previous year's conference on data
    archives, electronic records and access to information to which
    Denise Lievesley and Mark Conrad contributed (and which Mark
    co-edited). This was the first Irish publication devoted to the
    theme of electronic records and data archives.
:   The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) is funding a project to
    investigate the feasibility of an Irish Data Archive. The Data
    Archive at Essex was asked to undertake the feasibility study and
    Bridget Winstanley attended a scoping meeting in Dublin in December
    last year. Kevin Schurer has been appointed to carry out the
    feasibility study which will report to the SSRC in June this year.
:   Ken Hannigan's report pays tribute to the influence of IASSIST on
    the activity in Ireland:
:   "IASSISTers (yourself, Denise, Mark) have been directly involved
    while others such as Peggy Adams and Tom Browne have been offering
    intellectual and practical support from a distance.
:   You noted in your report last year that Mark Conrad had been
    appointed as a Fulbright Scholar in the Archives Department of
    University College Dublin for the academic year 1995-96. He finished
    his stint in June 1996 but I think that his influence over the
    archival profession here will be felt for a long time to come."

**EconData: a Dutch data service for economic data** 
:   In the summer of 1996 SWIDOC's Steinmetz Archive started the
    project EconData to establish a Dutch data service for economic
    data. This service will be integrated with the current activities of
    the archive. EconData builds on previous feasibility studies
    conducted by the Economic and Social Institute (ESI) in Amsterdam
    and the Economic Institute Tilburg (EIT). Both of these studies have
    been funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research
    (NWO). For EconData the Steinmetz Archive receives additional
    funding from NWO. This grant follows on a recommendation by the
    Social Science Council (SWR) of the Royal Nether-lands Academy of
    Arts and Sciences (KNAW).
:   EconData aims at broadening the scope of the Steinmetz Archive. New
    services will be established to support economic research, including
    macro-economics, business eco-nomics and economic modelling. In
    addition the more traditional functions of a data archive, EconData
    puts strong emphasis on data brokerage. The data service will act as
    an intermediary between suppliers of economic data and data users.
    This will include suppliers of international data and users of Dutch
    data abroad. For this purpose the project plan includes the
    establishment of an online register of available data sets,
    irrespective of whether these data sets are available from the
    Steinmetz Archive or from other sources. EconData will be evaluated
    after two years.
:   On July 1 drs. Albert Bots joined the Steinmetz Archive to act as
    project coordinator. He is currently active as lecturer at the
    department of Economics of the Free Univer-sity, Amster-dam. He is
    one of the authors of the aforementioned feasibility study by EIT.

**ECASS** 
:   Marcia Taylor has sent the following report:
:   The opening of the European Centre for Analysis in the Social
    Sciences (ECASS), a new large scale facility in the social sciences
    for European research and data analysis at the University of Essex
    was announced in the last issue. ECASS is an interdisciplinary
    research centre which conducts and facilitates the empirical study
    of social and economic change by integrating longitudinal and
    cross-national European datasets, providing support services
    required for their analyses, and acting as the host for major
    substantive research programmes, primary among them being
    longitudinal household panel and time budget studies. The Centre is
    coordinated by Marcia Freed Taylor, with John Brice as Database
    Manager. A short regular report on the ECASS activities and
    developments will appear in this and subsequent issues.
:   During its initial three months, the Centre has hosted several
    longer research visits, among them a visit of several weeks by Dr.
    Juergen Schupp from the Deutsches Institut fuer
    Wissenschaftsforschung in Berlin. Dr. Schupp works on the German
    Socio-economic Panel Study at DIW and carried out comparative
    analysis on the British Household Panel Study in collaboration with
    Dr. Malcolm Brynin of the ESRC Research Centre on Micro-social
    Change. He also spent some time with the Data Archive, identifying
    other potential data sources for further comparative work.
:   A research group from Belgium and the Netherlands, organised by Dr
    Walter Van Dongen, visited ECASS in March for a series of
    collaborative workshops with members of the ESRC Research Centre on
    Micro-social Change. A primary focus of interest of the seven
    researchers was the study of both the household division of labour
    and of female employment using the cross-national Time Budget data
    sets held by ECASS and the British Household Panel Study. Those who
    visited were from the Population and Family Study Centre (CBSG) in
    Antwerp (Van Dongen), the Panel Study of Belgian Households (Prof.
    Therese Jacobs), the University of Limburg (Prof. Mieke Van
    Haegendoren), and the Department of Comparative Population and
    Gender Economics of the University of Amsterdam (Prof. Hettie
    Pott-Buter, Dr. Kea Tijdens, Drs Susan Van Velzen and Wouter
    Buitenhuis). To continue with the joint research projects begun
    during this visit with Prof. Jay Gershuny and Dr Malcolm Brynin of
    the ESRC Research Centre, a follow-up visit is planned for later in
    the year.
:   The summer will be a particularly busy time, with over 16 fellows
    present. Some of these will attend courses at the Essex Summer
    School in Social Science Data Analysis and Collection (under full or
    partial ECASS bursaries) in addition to the comparative research
    work carried out using ECASS resources.
:   ECASS offers fellowships for periods of two weeks to three months to
    scientific researchers carrying out non-proprietary research who are
    nationals of a member state of the European Community or of an
    Associated State (currently Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and
    Israel), and who are working inside a member state of the European
    Community, or an Associated State. While UK researchers can make use
    of the facilities and assistance ECASS provides, EC rules prohibit
    the payment of travel and/or subsistence costs. UK researchers are
    nonetheless urged to apply to ECASS, which will provide them with
    help in obtaining access to the data sources on social change held
    at Essex and with assistance in their analysis.
