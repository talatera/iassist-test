Report of the Australian Regional Secretary

by
Vance Merrill
Social Science Data Archives
Australian National University
Canberra ACT
May 1997

During the past year, IASSIST gained an additional Australian member
(Len Smith, National Centre for Epidemiology & Population Health, the
Australian National University), yet most activity related to
Association aims continued to be carried out by the Social Science Data
Archives (SSDA) and ACSPRI (Australian Consortium for Social and
Political Research Incorporated). Whereas the SSDA acquires, preserves
and distributes social science data to Australian researchers; ACSPRI
encourages and supports activities which facilitate and enhance use of
these data. Membership of ACSPRI has grown by 5 in the past two years,
and the Consortium currently has 45 member institutions, including all
36 of Australia's publicly funded universities and 9 Commonweath
agencies.

Since the last report, the [SSDA](http://ssda.anu.edu.au/), in revamping
its web pages (http://ssda.anu.edu.au), implemented networked access to
its documentation and data by placing a number (currently 16) of its
User's Guides online and by developing its Online Analysis System in
the Social Sciences (OASSIS), enabling users to browse, search and/or
download (in RTF) codebooks before selecting (and recoding) variables
for simple (frequencies & crosstabs) analysis online. For more extensive
analysis, data sets may be ordered online by, and FTP'd to, users. The
ACSPRI Newsletter/SSDA News and the current Course Booklets for both the
ACSPRI Summer and Winter Programs in Social Research Methods and
Research Technology may be browsed/downloaded as well.

During the past two years, ACSPRI has conducted two more annual Summer
Programs at the ANU, and two additional Winter Programs in Adelaide and
Brisbane (in 1995 and 1996, respectively). In spite of substantial
Federal budget cuts to academia and the public service, all four
Programs were successful in attracting more participants then had the
immediately preceding Programs. The recently concluded 13th Summer
Program, for example, attracted 282 participants to twenty courses, and
was, in terms of the total number of courses taken, the largest to date.

However, the previous 1996 Summer Program was noteworthy for having
attracted research librarians from 8 Australian universities, the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Library, and the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) to a special workshop, conducted as part of the
Program, on 'Mainstreaming Social Science Data: Providing Data Services
in the Library'. Taught by North American IASSIST members Diane Geraci,
Chuck Humphrey and Jim Jacobs (aka the 'data amigos'), the five-day
workshop, while not immediately productive in terms of recruiting new
Australian members to the Association, succeeded in familiarising
participants with data library 'best practices' as they might apply
to, and/or be modified by, local circumstances.

None of the participating librarians had previous 'hands-on' computer
readable data processing experience, but they rated the workshop highly,
as did the 'data amigos' who, on departing Australia, wrote: "We had
a great time! And no complaints (well, except for the urinals and the
fact that you can't get a decent cookie). Really enjoyed meeting your
colleagues.... " (from: Amigos, Data, "It's time we face reality, my
friends.... We're not exactly rocket scientists.", Thank You Card,
Canberra: Jan. 1996.).

SSDA/ACSPRI continue to work to facilitate academic user access to ABS
unit record data, though an 'understanding' reached in early 1995
between ACSPRI/SSDA and the ABS for distribution of the Bureau's
existing and proposed confidentialised unit record files, or CURFs, did
not achieve formal agreement. That arrangement would have improved
academic access to ABS unit record data by halving the cost of purchases
by academic institutions from $5000 to $2500; currently, however, only
the Time Use Survey 1992 and Family Survey 1993 are being distributed
under the above pricing arrangement.

The period of uncertainty regarding arrangements for the dissemination
of CURFs to academia coincided with the appointment in 1995 of the
current Australian Statistician. His subsequent internal review of the
Bureau's structure and policies resulted in a substantial
reorganisation of the senior executive levels and a (seemingly) more
restrictive interpretation of the Census and Statistics Act (and the
most recent Ministerial Determination) that guide release of
'unidentifiable unit records'.

According to the C&S Act, the ABS cannot release data 'in a manner that
is likely to enable the identification of a particular person or
organisation'; the Determination requires recipients to sign an
undertaking that they must not attempt to identify individuals or
organisations, that the information will be used only for statistical
purposes and that it will not be disclosed to other individuals or
organisations. Moreover, to quote the Statistician: "If I consider it
necessary, I can impose further conditions...This Determination is an
enabling Determination; it does not compel me to release unit record
data. Before I authorise the release of microdata I need to be satisfied
that ABS guarantees in respect of confidentiality are not only met, but
are seen to be met." And, since "this is a very sensitive area" his
decisions, which are informed by advice from the ABS's Microdata Review
Panel, "are made on a case by case basis" (from: McLennan, W., "The
Product of The Australian Bureau of Statistics", Austral. J. Statist.
38(1), 1996, 1-14).

In the event, the ABS is now charging (academic and non-academic)
purchasers $7500 for each CURF created after 1 July 1996; no new CURFS
are available for secondary distribution by the SSDA; and no CURFs can
be distributed outside of Australia. It was in this context that a
feature article, based on materials generously supplied by Wendy Watkins
and Chuck Humphrey, on the Canadian Data Liberation Initiative (March
'96 ACSPRI Newsletter) generated enthusiasm among data users Down
Under, and sparked a cautious response from the ABS (see Sept. '96
ACSPRI Newsletter), which is now discussing ways and means.
