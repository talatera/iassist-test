### AUSTRALIA

**The Australian Social Science Data Archive**
ASSDA has been successful in gaining a 4.2 million dollar grant to
establish a national e-research service for the social sciences in
Australia. Based at the Australian National University's Supercomputer
Facility, this development will allow the operation of the virtual
organization and one-stop-shop with the design and development of tools
and middleware to support analysis across a wide range of data types.

The University of Western Australia ASSDA node was opened late last year
and the University of Technology Sydney, the University of Melbourne and
Griffith University will be opening in 2008/09. The University of
Technology Sydney will be opening the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Data Archive under the direction of Professor Martin Nakata,
the first Torres Strait Islander to obtain a PhD and an expert in access
protocols to Indigenous data. The University of Melbourne will be
specializing in Business and Economics data and the University of
Griffith in Crime and Policing data.

**Australian Consortium for Social and Political Research Incorporated
(ACSPRI)**
ACSPRI is holding its second conference in research methods at the
University of Sydney from Sunday December 7th to Wednesday December
10th. The invited speakers for this year's conference are Professor Lyn
Richards, founder of QSR International, and Professor Colm
O'Muircheartaigh, University of Chicago. There will be a stream on data
archiving and access, and it would be great to see other IASSISTers
attending the conference. Further information can be found when
available at <http://www.acspri.org.au>.

### NEW ZEALAND

**The New Zealand Social Science Data Service**
The Social Statistics Research Group at The University of Auckland, New
Zealand, has enjoyed a year's successful development of the New Zealand
Social Science Data Service (NZSSDS). It now has a web presence (at
<http://www.nzssds.org.nz>) a Drupal CMS site and a Nesstar WebView
interface, with 20 data sets processed and archived at time of writing,
further contacts awaiting follow-up, and a pending renewal of the
Nesstar licence. A number of presentations have been given around the
country to spread awareness and enthusiasm, and there have also been a
few interested parties from overseas.

We have been most lucky to receive support and guidance from the
Australian Social Science Data Archive in setting up the software at our
end, and getting started with the archiving, them having been custodians
of a series of New Zealand data sets since the closure of the previous
local effort, the New Zealand Social Research Data Archives.

**The New Zealand Social Statistics Network**
NZSSN has continued its role in the development of quantitative social
science research, with short courses held in February, one of which made
use of data archived with NZSSDS, and a presence at the TASA/SAANZ
conference at The University of Auckland in November, including
presentation and workshop sessions discussing data archiving and
showcasing NZSSDS and where it sits in the global picture.
