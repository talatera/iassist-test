IASSIST Report of the African Regional Secretary

By
Kizito Kasozi
Director Information Technology
Uganda Bureau of Statistics
2010

This report is centered on the recent developments in the African
region. Since the introduction of the micro-data management toolkit in
2003, Africa has realized more of national datasets documented and
archived. With support from the Accelerated Data Program (ADP) and
International Household Survey Network, Africa has been able to create
valuable national data archives. In addition to that, efforts towards
general improvement in data management are being realized. More support
is being realized from alternative partners. The challenge lies in the
level of commitment and ultimate sustainability of these efforts.

**National Data Archives (NADA)**

Since the last report more countries have advanced in developing
national data archives. Below is the current status of the NADA
development.

-   Cote Devoir - 18
-   Ethiopia - 80
-   Gambia - 10
-   Ghana - 15
-   Lesotho - 3
-   Liberia - 9
-   Malawi - 3
-   Mozambique - 11

-   Nigeria - 23
-   Senegal - 22
-   Uganda - 11
-   Zambia - 23

ADP/IHSN has continued to support this activity as well as other areas
aimed at improving data quality and accessibility. Links to the NADAs
can be found on the AASDA and ADP websites or individual country

and later upgraded the Mozambique NADA in December 2009.

In May 2009, DataFirst hosted and trained participants form Botswana,
Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe in data curation at a workshop
organized by the World Bank.

participants from the different countries on the latest practices and
innovations in data management. Ms. Lynn Wooflrey from DataFirst and Mr.
Kizito Kasozi made presentation on practices and progress in data
curation in Africa. The workshop strongly recommended open access to

-4 2010 for selected Francophone African countries.

**African Association of Statistical Data Archivists (AASDA)**

There was no significant activity by the association. All planned
activities could not be implemented due to lack of funding. There is
still very low commitment from the members.
