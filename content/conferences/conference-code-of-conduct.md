The International Association for Social Science Information Services & Technology (IASSIST) holds its conferences to enable its members to share research on, and innovations in, the social sciences data lifecycle, to receive continuing education and to build professional networks.

To provide all participants – members and other attendees, speakers, exhibitors, staff and volunteers – the opportunity to benefit from the event, IASSIST is dedicated to a positive, safe and harassment-free conference experience in which diverse participants may learn, network and enjoy the company of colleagues in an environment of mutual human respect and regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, physical appearance, ethnicity, religion or other group identity or political beliefs. We recognize a shared responsibility to create and hold that environment for the benefit of all. Harassment, therefore, is specifically prohibited.

Harassment is any verbal or non-verbal behaviour that threatens another person or group and that reinforces social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age and/or religion. Examples of harassing behaviour include

- the gratuitous use of sexual images in public spaces,
- deliberate intimidation,
- stalking,
- following,
- harassing photography or recording,
- sustained disruption of talks or other events,
- inappropriate physical contact, and
- unwelcome sexual attention.

Speakers are asked to frame discussions as openly and inclusively as possible and to be aware of how language or images may be perceived by others, especially given the international aspect of this organization.

All participants are expected to observe these rules and behaviors in all conference venues, including online venues, and conference social events. Conference participants seek to learn, network and have fun. Please do so responsibly and with respect for the right of others to do likewise. Participants asked to stop a hostile or harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the IASSIST President.
